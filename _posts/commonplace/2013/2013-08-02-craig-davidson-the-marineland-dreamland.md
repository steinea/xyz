"This is the most dangerous element about memory. If it means enough to us, we can convince ourselves that almost anything happened." 

"You know those hysterical giggles you get when a situation is so absurd, shocking, or terrifying that they're more a form of damage control? The laughter boils up your throat with a fizzy club soda effervescence, impossible to tamp down, intent on releasing the poison inside you."

"Before long, we have run through our shared stories, and a distance settles between us--nothing more than the years piling up with their faultless arithmetic."

"suffering is necessary simply because our world's problems far outstrip our capacity to furnish correctives."
