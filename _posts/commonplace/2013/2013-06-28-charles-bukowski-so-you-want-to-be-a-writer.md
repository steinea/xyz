if it doesn't come bursting out of you
<br> in spite of everything,
<br> don't do it.
<br> unless it comes unasked out of your
<br> heart and your mind and your mouth
<br> and your gut,
<br> don't do it.
<br> if you have to sit for hours
<br> staring at your computer screen
<br> or hunched over your
<br> typewriter
<br> searching for words,
<br> don't do it.
<br> if you're doing it for money or
<br> fame,
<br> don't do it.
<br> if you're doing it because you want
<br> women in your bed,
<br> don't do it.
<br> if you have to sit there and
<br> rewrite it again and again,
<br> don't do it.
<br> if it's hard work just thinking about doing it,
<br> don't do it.
<br> if you're trying to write like somebody
<br> else,
<br> forget about it.

if you have to wait for it to roar out of
<br> you,
<br> then wait patiently.
<br> if it never does roar out of you,
<br> do something else.

if you first have to read it to your wife
<br> or your girlfriend or your boyfriend
<br> or your parents or to anybody at all,
<br> you're not ready.

don't be like so many writers,
<br> don't be like so many thousands of
<br> people who call themselves writers,
<br> don't be dull and boring and
<br> pretentious, don't be consumed with self-
<br> love.
<br> the libraries of the world have
<br> yawned themselves to
<br> sleep
<br> over your kind.
<br> don't add to that.
<br> don't do it.
<br> unless it comes out of
<br> your soul like a rocket,
<br> unless being still would
<br> drive you to madness or
<br> suicide or murder,
<br> don't do it.
<br> unless the sun inside you is
<br> burning your gut,
<br> don't do it.

when it is truly time,
<br> and if you have been chosen,
<br> it will do it by
<br> itself and it will keep on doing it
<br> until you die or it dies in you.

there is no other way.

and there never was.


--Bukowski
