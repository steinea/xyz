Where now the horse and the rider?Â 
<br>Where is the horn that was blowing?
<br>Where is the helm and the hauberk, and the bright hair flowing?
<br>Where is the hand on the harpstring, and the red fire glowing?
<br>Where is the spring and the harvest and the tall corn growing?
<br>They have passed like rain on the mountain, like a wind in the meadow;
<br>The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into shadow.
<br>Who shall gather the smoke of the dead wood burning,
<br>Or behold the flowing years from the Sea returning?
