Reading DISPARITIES (2)

“There is no need for the one-sided fantasmatic identification with the thought of one of these figures and scathing condemnation of the rest.”

“From the beginning Zizek applies this perspective, arguing for a disparate reading of Hegel as against a reconciliatory reading. He opposes the disparate un-determined Kraken to the uniform holistic deterministic mole. He deploys the elements of disparity he finds in Kant, Hegel, Lacan, Heidegger, Badiou and others to re-think his analysis of the contemporary field of thought.”

“In the first chapter Zizek discusses a number of thinkers who either belong to the movement of speculative realism or are thematically associated with it: Franco Berardi, McKenzie Wark, Karen Barad, Ray Brassier, Timothy Morton, McKenzie Wark, Adrian Johnston. In each case he locates in the interior of each thinker’s work the disparatous elements that he favours and sets them against the forgetting of disparity that continues to block thought within the confines of the Big Other.”

“From Karen Barad Zizek takes the notion of the apparatus as an inhuman mediation of the inhuman to the human, enabling us not only to get to know the inhuman real but also to construct new devices on inhuman bases.”

“From Timothy Morton, he takes the disparatous nature of hyperobjects as heralding the change in our conceptual apparatus needed not only to comprehend but even to apprehend the Anthropocene.”
