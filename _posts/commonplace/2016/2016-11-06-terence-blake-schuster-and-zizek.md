“I wish to distinguish the dialectical and the ontological Zizek from the psychoanalytical Zizek. The psychoanalytical Zizek with his dogmatic Lacanianism constitutes a monstrous regression in thinking, back to pre-Deleuzian times. The dialectical and ontological Zizek contributes interesting ideas both to the contemporary debate and to our vision of recent philosophical history.”

“Zizek even goes so far as to declare “I will never pardon in Deleuze his defence of Jung”. In fact, he will not pardon Deleuze’s freedom of spirit.”

“Zizek does not even need Lacan as a source for his conceptual creations. He needs Lacan in a second time as a replacement for argument. Instead of arguing for his ideas and theses (and admitting sharing a lot with Deleuze) Zizek “finds” them in Lacan, QED. Those who differ are condemned tautologically as non-Lacanian.”

“Every time Zizek mentions Jung he turns him into a symbol of the closed and harmonious totality that he supposedly rejects. More deeply, Jung is a symbol of the openness, disunity and pluralism that Zizek flees, preferring the closed little unified world of retro-French Theory.”
