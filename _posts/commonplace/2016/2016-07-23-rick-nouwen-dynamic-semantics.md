“Dynamic semantics is a perspective on natural language semantics that emphasizes the growth of information in time.”

“It is an approach to meaning representation where pieces of text or discourse are viewed as instructions to update an existing context with new information, the result of which is an updated context.”

“In a slogan: meaning is context change potential.”

“Dynamic semantics aims to model meaning and interpretation. You can do that without answering broader philosophical questions such as the question of what it is that makes it possible for the subject to be related to these meanings at all.”
