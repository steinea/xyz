Of David.

1 To you, O Lord, I lift up my soul.
<br> 2 O my God, in you I trust;
<br>     do not let me be put to shame;
<br>     do not let my enemies exult over me.
<br> 3 Do not let those who wait for you be put to shame;
<br>     let them be ashamed who are wantonly treacherous.
<br> 4 Make me to know your ways, O Lord;
<br>     teach me your paths.
<br> 5 Lead me in your truth, and teach me,
<br>     for you are the God of my salvation;
<br>     for you I wait all day long.
<br> 6 Be mindful of your mercy, O Lord, and of your steadfast love,
<br>     for they have been from of old.
<br> 7 Do not remember the sins of my youth or my transgressions;
<br>     according to your steadfast love remember me,
<br>     for your goodness’ sake, O Lord!
<br> 8 Good and upright is the Lord;
<br>     therefore he instructs sinners in the way.
<br> 9 He leads the humble in what is right,
<br>     and teaches the humble his way.
<br> 10 All the paths of the Lord are steadfast love and faithfulness,
<br>     for those who keep his covenant and his decrees.
<br> 11 For your name’s sake, O Lord,
<br>     pardon my guilt, for it is great.
<br> 12 Who are they that fear the Lord?
<br>     He will teach them the way that they should choose.
<br> 13 They will abide in prosperity,
<br>     and their children shall possess the land.
<br> 14 The friendship of the Lord is for those who fear him,
<br>     and he makes his covenant known to them.
<br> 15 My eyes are ever toward the Lord,
<br>     for he will pluck my feet out of the net.
<br> 16 Turn to me and be gracious to me,
<br>     for I am lonely and afflicted.
<br> 17 Relieve the troubles of my heart,
<br>     and bring me[a] out of my distress.
<br> 18 Consider my affliction and my trouble,
<br>     and forgive all my sins.
<br> 19 Consider how many are my foes,
<br>     and with what violent hatred they hate me.
<br> 20 O guard my life, and deliver me;
<br>     do not let me be put to shame, for I take refuge in you.
<br> 21 May integrity and uprightness preserve me,
<br>     for I wait for you.
<br> 22 Redeem Israel, O God,
<br>     out of all its troubles.
