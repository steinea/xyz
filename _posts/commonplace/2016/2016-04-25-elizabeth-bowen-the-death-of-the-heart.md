"Feelings are at once more powerful and more controlled as one ages. The more memories a person has, the greater the experiential and emotional resonance there will be. This acts both like an earthquake in that the amplitude of feeling is magnified and like sonar with memories serving as a sort of anchor that gives the feeling direction and shape." 

Bowen, The Death of the Heart, p. 158
