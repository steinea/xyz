“While most American voters were asleep, Trump was up and tweeting about things that were making him angry.”

“Trump is a Twitter addict and a night owl.”

“But he doesn't tweet late at night because he's mad, he tweets late at night because he tweets late at night. Because he had something he wanted to say right at that minute and so he said it, instead of, say, going to sleep (or going back to sleep).”

“And that, of course, was Clinton's entire point.”
