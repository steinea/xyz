“The imperative to ironize violence necessarily relies on the presumption that hate originates from a point of distance.”

“Because hate–and its attendant calls for security, sovereignty, and control–is cathected through the desire for isolation, it’s difficult to convince white people that their safety is an illusion.”

“We live in the point of distance. My family was promised refuge and all we fucking got was this point of distance: a home without heat, no interior, all beams, whittled thin.”

“Here is what the last few days have reminded me: White men, even those on the left, are so safe, so insulated from the policies of a reactionary presidency, that many of them view politics as entertainment, a distraction without consequences in which they get to indulge their vanity by fantasizing that they are on the side of good.”

“They will continue to talk over the voices of those with the most at risk, even though they themselves are the least threatened.”

“The left will not be able to meaningfully organize without the willingness of white men to prioritize the vulnerabilities of those who are not like them, and therefore, I fear that the left will not be able to organize at all.”

“It is not a coincidence that white men are the demographic that was most likely to support this candidate before the election, and it is not a coincidence that they are an obstacle to our ability to act against him now.”
