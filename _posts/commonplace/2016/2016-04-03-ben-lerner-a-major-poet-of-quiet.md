“There are plenty of direct statements, moments of humor and pathos, but we come to know Waldrop most through his subtle, exquisite compositional decisions: the way he breaks a line or collages found language.”

“I think here of the perfectly balanced epigrammatic poem “Proposition II”:

Each grain of sand has its architecture, but
<br>a desert displays the structure of the wind.”
