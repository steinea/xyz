“This most welcome volume is an augmented reprinting of the 1825 A Critical Essay on the Gospel of St. Luke, itself a translation of  ber die Schriften des Lukas (1817). Schleiermacher's own source-critical monograph on Luke forms the inmost of three concentric circles, with translator Thirlwall's introductory essay and editor Tice's Introduction, Appendices and Apparatus surrounding it.”
