God cares for the:

* oppressed
* hungry
* prisoners
* blind
* bowed down
* strangers
* orphans
* widows

Psalm 146:2-9

New Revised Standard Version (NRSV)

I will praise the Lord as long as I live;
<br>    I will sing praises to my God all my life long. 
<br>Do not put your trust in princes,
<br>    in mortals, in whom there is no help.
<br>When their breath departs, they return to the earth;
<br>    on that very day their plans perish.
<br>Happy are those whose help is the God of Jacob,
<br>    whose hope is in the Lord their God,
<br>who made heaven and earth,
<br>    the sea, and all that is in them;
<br>who keeps faith forever;
<br>    who executes justice for the oppressed;
<br>    who gives food to the hungry.
<br>The Lord sets the prisoners free;
<br>    the Lord opens the eyes of the blind.
<br>The Lord lifts up those who are bowed down;
<br>    the Lord loves the righteous.
<br>The Lord watches over the strangers;
<br>    he upholds the orphan and the widow,
<br>    but the way of the wicked he brings to ruin.
