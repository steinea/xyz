"Pharmakos is also used as a vital term in Derridean deconstruction. In his essay 'Plato's Pharmacy,' Jacques Derrida deconstructs several texts by Plato, such as *Phaedrus*, and reveals the inter-connection between the word chain *pharmakeia–pharmakon–pharmakeus* and the notably absent word *pharmakos*. In doing so, he attacks the boundary between inside and outside, declaring that the outside (pharmakos, never uttered by Plato) is always-already present right behind the inside (*pharmakeia–pharmakon–pharmakeus*). As a concept, Pharmakos can be said to be related to other Derridian terms such as 'Trace.'"
