“AFTER SELLING OUT its original UK edition on Eyewear Publishing, Mandy Kahn’s remarkable first collection of poems, Math, Heaven, Time, is now available in an American paperback edition.”

“Of the influences she names, Thoreau seems to have left his transcendental nature print most prominently. There’s also a sense of Yeats’s splendor and, at times, the concision of Dickinson, but as with all true visionaries, her alchemy creates a completely new sound — a melopoeia that is both familiar and otherworldly.”

“The more I read of her, the more I feel the living music that informs all Kahn creates.”

“LOIS P. JONES: I’ve read Math, Heaven, Time several times, heard you at readings more than once, and still you are a kind of literary origami, mysteriously folded, and even if your creases were pressed back into their original form, we would still not know you personally. Is this sense of distance a quality you are conscious of? Do you feel that art should be separate from the individual artist, and is that possible?”

“MANDY KAHN: I am aware of this distance, but think of it as a shyness that swells and recedes. As I do this work, and also the work of sharing it, and standing for it, I do my best to honor the feelings that come.”
