“Tech is never simply technology.”

“t never appears in the abstract, any more than the characters “H2O” appear anywhere on water.”

“Tech is always specific.”

“How old should someone be when they first have sex? How old before they get their first cell phone? This sequence unsettles us because it is hard to think about either inevitability. Sex and technology are instruments of desire, the objects and system of adult unfreedom.”

“Any ontology of Silicon Valley must include this new technics of reproduction”

“In the ascendant project of technocracy, these new philosophies represent new techniques of governance.”
