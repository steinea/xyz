“TV, which by its most basic structure implies progression and development, has taught us to look at Hannah’s story and search for change. Instead, at least up until this point in season five, we are routinely denied that pleasure.”

“It’s possible this is a political statement about a young woman steadfastly refusing to conform to our requirements for satisfaction, be they in the shape of her character’s progression or her TV show’s arc. It’s also possible that in the next few episodes, or as the series moves into conclusion mode during season six, all of this stonewalling will be undone as Hannah slowly wakens to a new understanding of herself as a small piece of a bigger world. But at the moment, we’re stuck with Hannah: selfish, infuriating, disgusting, and utterly unconcerned with your approval.”
