“Until now, says Sherwood, space habitats have been about the bare essentials: “What’s the research we have to do, what’s the equipment we have to carry, and what’s the most cost-effective thing we can stick it all in?” But as more people travel to space for increasingly long periods of time, their physical environment and its psychological effects are becoming more important.”

““The way you become a space millionaire is by starting off as a billionaire.””
