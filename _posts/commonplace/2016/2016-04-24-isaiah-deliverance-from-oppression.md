O Lord, you are my God;
<br>I will exalt you, I will praise your name;
<br>for you have done wonderful things,
<br>plans formed of old, faithful and sure.
<br>For you have made the city a heap,
<br>the fortified city a ruin;
<br>the palace of aliens is a city no more,
<br>it will never be rebuilt.
<br>Therefore strong peoples will glorify you;
<br>cities of ruthless nations will fear you.
<br>For you have been a refuge to the poor,
<br>a refuge to the needy in their distress,
<br>a shelter from the rainstorm and a shade from the heat.
<br>When the blast of the ruthless was like a winter rainstorm,
<br>the noise of aliens like heat in a dry place,
<br>you subdued the heat with the shade of clouds;
<br>the song of the ruthless was stilled.
<br>On this mountain the Lord of hosts will make for all peoples
<br>a feast of rich food, a feast of well-aged wines,
<br>of rich food filled with marrow, of well-aged wines strained clear.
<br>And he will destroy on this mountain
<br>the shroud that is cast over all peoples,
<br>the sheet that is spread over all nations;
<br>he will swallow up death forever.
<br>Then the Lord God will wipe away the tears from all faces,
<br>and the disgrace of his people he will take away from all the earth,
<br>for the Lord has spoken.
<br>It will be said on that day,
<br>Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, so that he might save us.
<br>This is the Lord for whom we have waited;
<br>let us be glad and rejoice in his salvation.
<br>For the hand of the Lord will rest on this mountain.
<br>The Moabites shall be trodden down in their place
<br>as straw is trodden down in a dung-pit.
<br>Though they spread out their hands in the midst of it,
<br>as swimmers spread out their hands to swim,
<br>their pride will be laid low despite the struggle[a] of their hands.
<br>The high fortifications of his walls will be brought down,
<br>laid low, cast to the ground, even to the dust.
