“In short, religion, at least in the United States, is dying out with its (aging) adherents, pretty much as it has in northern Europe.”

“Why all the chutzpah? Because, he says, in the fight against faith, “we’re winning.” Winners do not need to hedge or apologize. Yes, he’s preaching to the choir, but it has been a singularly timid choir, and he is writing to embolden it.”

“He closes this chapter as he does others, asking for frankness: “If you’re an atheist and still call yourself a Jew, please reconsider what’s important — and what’s true.””

“Some readers might wonder, does it matter? If one calls oneself Jewish, or Christian or whatever, what’s the harm in that? If belief were truly a personal matter, not much. But with evangelicals still accounting for a quarter of all Americans, and generally voting as a bloc, the electoral implications of the rise of the Nones are clear. Faith skews political discourse to the right.”
