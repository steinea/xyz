“Action takes time, unfolds in time.”

“Intentions persist through time, our deliberations are sensitive to time, our commitments maintained through time.”

“The promise of this collection -- the result of the Time and Agency Conference held at George Washington University in 2011 -- is to reveal substantial truths behind these apparent truisms -- "that time structures agency from within", "that time is an ineliminable constituent of agency" (1).”

“Put simply, to understand action we must understand the role of time in action, intention, deliberation, and commitment.”

“the idea is that any correct characterization of agency must make mention of time”

“None of these is for the novice or the faint of heart, unnerved by technicality and jargon. But there are indeed several that anyone interested in action should read.”

“The 16 essays are divided into four parts along with the editors' helpful introduction: Part I "The Metaphysics of Action," Part II "Diachronic Practical Rationality," Part III "Deliberation, Motivation, and Agency," and Part IV "Phenomenology and the Temporality of Agency."”
