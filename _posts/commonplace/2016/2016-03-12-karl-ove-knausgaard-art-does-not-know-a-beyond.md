“Art has become an unmade bed, a couple of photocopiers in a room, a motorbike in an attic. And art has come to be a spectator of itself. Art does not know a beyond… Those in this situation who call for more intellectual depth, more spirituality, have understood nothing, for the problem is that the intellect has taken over everything. The limits of that which cannot speak to us – the unfathomable – no longer exist. We understand everything, and we do so because we have turned everything into ourselves.”
