“Zizek highlights diverse Deleuzo-Guattarian themes (immanence, incompletude, disparity) that are to be found “already” in Lacan. But this retrospective movement proves too much. Zizek is only able to find in Lacan what he is looking for, and it is thanks to Deleuze that he knows what he is looking for.”

“These Deleuzo-Guattarian themes are present in the earlier Lacan, but antagonistically: he is already repressing them before Deleuze and Guattari came to give them greater salience and valorisation. Lacan was repressing himself and the more radical consequences of his ideas, which is what made the Deleuzo-Guattarian rupture both possible and traumatic.”
