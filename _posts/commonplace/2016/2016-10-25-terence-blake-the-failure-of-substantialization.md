Reading DISPARITIES (6)

“OOO reinforces the very dualism that it purports to escape. The naturalisation of the object is accompanied by the substantialisation of the subject, which in turn must be compensated by a more or less poetic re-subjectivation (or “re-enchantment”) of the real.”

“Zizek advocates a reprise of the contrary movement, from substance to subject, that is to say he proposes to undercut OOO’s secondary re-subjectivation of the object (regressive re-enchantment) by means of a renewed concept of the subject as de-substantialized. This movement of de-substantialization was accomplished, in Zizek’s view by Lacan and by the Deleuze of LOGIC OF SENSE.”

“Here Zizek’s terminology and argument become murky indeed, but the main lines are clear. We need a concept of pure appearance that is not the appearing of anything.”

“This de-substantialization of appearance corresponds to Lacan’s semblance and to Deleuze’s simulacrum.”
