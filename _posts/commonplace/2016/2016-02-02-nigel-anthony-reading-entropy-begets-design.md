“Design is an emergent property of and irreversibility and entropy.”

“Complexity increase in nature can then be seen as ultimately – a result of a geometric imperative, as an evolutionary, asymptotic convergence in open dynamical systems that explains the phenomena of emergence via dynamical systems Universality.”

“So once again, design in nature and culture is an emergent, optimal, analogical property of irreversibility and entropy.”

“Confirmed proof in 2006; Asynsis principle describes optimal, analogical geometric signatures of principle of least action via Universality, which is conjectured to be a classical analogue of the quantum superposition, thereby optimising a system’s information processing, predictive inference, sustainability and adaptive resiliency capacity.”
