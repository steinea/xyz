      I

Complacencies of the peignoir, and late 
<br>Coffee and oranges in a sunny chair, 
<br>And the green freedom of a cockatoo 
<br>Upon a rug mingle to dissipate 
<br>The holy hush of ancient sacrifice. 
<br>She dreams a little, and she feels the dark 
<br>Encroachment of that old catastrophe, 
<br>As a calm darkens among water-lights. 
<br>The pungent oranges and bright, green wings 
<br>Seem things in some procession of the dead, 
<br>Winding across wide water, without sound. 
<br>The day is like wide water, without sound, 
<br>Stilled for the passing of her dreaming feet 
<br>Over the seas, to silent Palestine, 
<br>Dominion of the blood and sepulchre. 


       II

Why should she give her bounty to the dead? 
<br>What is divinity if it can come 
<br>Only in silent shadows and in dreams? 
<br>Shall she not find in comforts of the sun, 
<br>In pungent fruit and bright, green wings, or else 
<br>In any balm or beauty of the earth, 
<br>Things to be cherished like the thought of heaven? 
<br>Divinity must live within herself: 
<br>Passions of rain, or moods in falling snow; 
<br>Grievings in loneliness, or unsubdued 
<br>Elations when the forest blooms; gusty 
<br>Emotions on wet roads on autumn nights; 
<br>All pleasures and all pains, remembering 
<br>The bough of summer and the winter branch. 
<br>These are the measures destined for her soul. 


       III

Jove in the clouds had his inhuman birth. 
<br>No mother suckled him, no sweet land gave 
<br>Large-mannered motions to his mythy mind. 
<br>He moved among us, as a muttering king, 
<br>Magnificent, would move among his hinds, 
<br>Until our blood, commingling, virginal, 
<br>With heaven, brought such requital to desire 
<br>The very hinds discerned it, in a star. 
<br>Shall our blood fail? Or shall it come to be 
<br>The blood of paradise? And shall the earth 
<br>Seem all of paradise that we shall know? 
<br>The sky will be much friendlier then than now, 
<br>A part of labor and a part of pain, 
<br>And next in glory to enduring love, 
<br>Not this dividing and indifferent blue. 


       IV

She says, “I am content when wakened birds, 
<br>Before they fly, test the reality 
<br>Of misty fields, by their sweet questionings; 
<br>But when the birds are gone, and their warm fields 
<br>Return no more, where, then, is paradise?” 
<br>There is not any haunt of prophecy, 
<br>Nor any old chimera of the grave, 
<br>Neither the golden underground, nor isle 
<br>Melodious, where spirits gat them home, 
<br>Nor visionary south, nor cloudy palm 
<br>Remote on heaven’s hill, that has endured 
<br>As April’s green endures; or will endure 
<br>Like her remembrance of awakened birds, 
<br>Or her desire for June and evening, tipped 
<br>By the consummation of the swallow’s wings. 


       V

She says, “But in contentment I still feel 
<br>The need of some imperishable bliss.” 
<br>Death is the mother of beauty; hence from her, 
<br>Alone, shall come fulfilment to our dreams 
<br>And our desires. Although she strews the leaves 
<br>Of sure obliteration on our paths, 
<br>The path sick sorrow took, the many paths 
<br>Where triumph rang its brassy phrase, or love 
<br>Whispered a little out of tenderness, 
<br>She makes the willow shiver in the sun 
<br>For maidens who were wont to sit and gaze 
<br>Upon the grass, relinquished to their feet. 
<br>She causes boys to pile new plums and pears 
<br>On disregarded plate. The maidens taste 
<br>And stray impassioned in the littering leaves. 


       VI

Is there no change of death in paradise? 
<br>Does ripe fruit never fall? Or do the boughs 
<br>Hang always heavy in that perfect sky, 
<br>Unchanging, yet so like our perishing earth, 
<br>With rivers like our own that seek for seas 
<br>They never find, the same receding shores 
<br>That never touch with inarticulate pang? 
<br>Why set the pear upon those river-banks 
<br>Or spice the shores with odors of the plum? 
<br>Alas, that they should wear our colors there, 
<br>The silken weavings of our afternoons, 
<br>And pick the strings of our insipid lutes! 
<br>Death is the mother of beauty, mystical, 
<br>Within whose burning bosom we devise 
<br>Our earthly mothers waiting, sleeplessly. 


       VII

Supple and turbulent, a ring of men 
<br>Shall chant in orgy on a summer morn 
<br>Their boisterous devotion to the sun, 
<br>Not as a god, but as a god might be, 
<br>Naked among them, like a savage source. 
<br>Their chant shall be a chant of paradise, 
<br>Out of their blood, returning to the sky; 
<br>And in their chant shall enter, voice by voice, 
<br>The windy lake wherein their lord delights, 
<br>The trees, like serafin, and echoing hills, 
<br>That choir among themselves long afterward. 
<br>They shall know well the heavenly fellowship 
<br>Of men that perish and of summer morn. 
<br>And whence they came and whither they shall go 
<br>The dew upon their feet shall manifest. 


       VIII

She hears, upon that water without sound, 
<br>A voice that cries, “The tomb in Palestine 
<br>Is not the porch of spirits lingering. 
<br>It is the grave of Jesus, where he lay.” 
<br>We live in an old chaos of the sun, 
<br>Or old dependency of day and night, 
<br>Or island solitude, unsponsored, free, 
<br>Of that wide water, inescapable. 
<br>Deer walk upon our mountains, and the quail 
<br>Whistle about us their spontaneous cries; 
<br>Sweet berries ripen in the wilderness; 
<br>And, in the isolation of the sky, 
<br>At evening, casual flocks of pigeons make 
<br>Ambiguous undulations as they sink, 
<br>Downward to darkness, on extended wings.
