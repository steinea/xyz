“Apart from the chapter-length treatments of the key historical figures listed above, we encounter discussions of developmental psychologists (e.g., Paul Bloom, Michael Tomasello), ancient philosophers (e.g., Plato, Cratylus), medieval philosophers (e.g., Aquinas) early modern philosophers (e.g., Descartes, Hume, Locke), analytic philosophers (e.g., Russell, Austin, Quine, Davidson, Kuhn, Searle, Kripke, Alva Nöe, Evan Thompson, Michael Thompson, Shaun Gallagher, Dan Zahavi) and continental philosophers (e.g., Nietzsche, Husserl, Heidegger, Gadamer, Robert Sokolowski).”

“Part of the writerly charm of this book is that we also come across references to Charlotte Brontë, Gerard Manley Hopkins, T.S. Eliot, Roald Dahl and Woody Allen.”
