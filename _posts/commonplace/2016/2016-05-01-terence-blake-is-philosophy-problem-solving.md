“There is not a single real concept in this post, except the presupposed, scientistic, concept of philosophy as problem-solving. It is more an opinion piece than a serious philosophical attempt to raise a real question. It partakes of the concept-blindness that characterises both much of modern analytic philosophy and speculative realism. In cinematic terms this amounts to seeing THE MARTIAN as a greater film than 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY because the second film presents more problems than it solves.”

“Philosophy is much more the construction of problematics than the resolution of problems (though it is that too).”

“This is not just my opinion, but is the way philosophy is taught in high schools and university everywhere in France, where I live and teach. This is also the way it is practised here. Bergson, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, Bachelard, Deleuze, Foucault and Derrida did nothing else, as do Badiou, Stiegler, Latour, and Laruelle today.”

“There is not a single French philosopher who tries to answer a pre-existing question without first deconstructing the question, making explicit its presupposed concepts and underlying problematic, and proposing different (or at least re-worked) concepts and problematics.”

“A question or a problem is not the same when it is taken up into an incommensurable problematic, but only bears a family resemblance to its other avatars.”

“Scientism comes in when one regards philosophy as necessarily proceeding in the same way as the sciences, taken as problem-solving endeavours.”
