“While at the Sorbonne, [Ricoeur] wrote three works that cemented his reputation: Fallible Man and The Symbolism of Evilpublished in 1960, and Freud and Philosophy: An Essay on Interpretation published in 1965. Freud and Philosophy contains the famous assertion that Marx, Nietzsche and Freud are masters of the school of suspicion[5][6][7](maîtres du soupçon/école du soupçon).”
