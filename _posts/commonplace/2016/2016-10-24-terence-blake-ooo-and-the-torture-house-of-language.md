Reading DISPARITIES (5)

“I think that Zizek has located an important weak point in OOO, namely its philosophy of language. How can we say anything meaningful about that which withdraws behind an apophatic veil? However Zizek’s own solution is left vague and undevelopped.”

“Bryant presents this essential reference to a non-human Real outside language as a key feature of his onticology and criticises Lacan’s entrapment in the Symbolic. To escape this entrapment he relies on the supplementation of Lacanian psychoanalysis with scientistic naturalism, creating a strange hybrid that cannot account for its own ability to refer to the non-linguistic real except by the imperious insistence that it must be so.”
