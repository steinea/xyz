“ARCHITECTURE has a limited vocabulary for hunger.”

“Desire is a way of “negotiating the real,” as historian K. Michael Hays has written, and as the concretion of the real itself, architecture is less about built objects than lived experience.”

“Desire in architecture is motivated not by lack—sterility, division and fear—but the excess and complexity of life and death.”

“The production and experience of the city are a two-way street.”

“While as a literary text the Hypnerotomachia has been dismissed as a silly Renaissance romance, it is also the most postmodern novel to appear until the 1920s, one of the world’s first graphic novels, a love epic, and an allegory of Platonic ideals. An atlas of fragment and alchemy and hieroglyphics, it is the strangest architectural treatise ever written, an ode to the polis not erupting from the forest but cemented in it. Four hundred years before psychoanalysis, the Hypnerotomachia dealt in the language of sleep and nighttime, seen not only as something sacred, but something to be feared.”

“the privileging of technology—in fact the visual—has led to a crisis of representation in modernity and loss of meaning in architecture”
