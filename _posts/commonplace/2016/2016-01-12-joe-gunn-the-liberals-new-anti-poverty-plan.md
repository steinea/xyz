“here are five key characteristics any solid national strategy should include.”

“1. It has to be comprehensive.

Poverty has multiple dimensions. Key areas of focus where federal policy can address poverty include income security, housing, food security, health, early childhood education and care, and employment.”

“2. It has to be targeted.

It is clear that firm targets and timelines, legislated by Parliament, are essential to an effective poverty reduction strategy”

“3. Consultation is essential.

An effective, responsive poverty reduction strategy must be shaped by broad consultation. This must involve people with lived experience of poverty, first of all. It also requires close collaboration across levels of government and across ministries.”

“4. It needs to put human rights at its core.

A national poverty reduction strategy should be developed as part of a larger human rights framework. This includes recognizing that Canada has ratified international human rights conventions that obligate us to address poverty as a human rights violation.”

“5. It needs to be fully funded.

Of course, a national poverty reduction strategy can only work if there is dedicated funding attached.”
