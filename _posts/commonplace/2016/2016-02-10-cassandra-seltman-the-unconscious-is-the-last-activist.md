“PATRICIA GHEROVICI is a Lacanian psychoanalyst practicing in Philadelphia whose work seeks to bridge several key divides: between psychoanalysis and activism, and between the complex language of theory and the needs of a broad readership.”

“Gherovici’s work shows how psychoanalysis can have relevance in a trans discourse that has become simplified by pop culture journalism.”

“inscription, and editing that takes place in analysis. They are parallel processes.”

“A narrative has been written and left certain traces in the body; these traces turn into symptoms; hopefully, through the process of analysis, that text will be rewritten, thus maybe authored, but also possibly forgotten.”

“An analysis reinstates the position of the author with the freedom that an author has.”

“You might want to delete a paragraph or reduce a text to one page. At times, analysands come to see us when the effects of their texts are too great. The process of writing is always a process of rewriting, and analysands can relate to the text differently.”

“In a process of inscription, things are at times written without your knowing.”

“Such and such a text has been written on you, on your body, and often, if you can read it you can rewrite it. The analysand becomes an author, and also authorizes herself or himself.”
