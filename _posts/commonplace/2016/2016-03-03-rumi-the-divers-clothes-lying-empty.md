You are sitting here with us,
<br>but you are also out walking in a field at dawn.

You are yourself the animal we hunt
<br>when you come with us on the hunt.

You are in your body
<br>like a plant is solid in the ground,
<br>yet you are wind.

You are the diver's clothes
<br>lying empty on the beach.
<br>You are the fish.

In the ocean are many bright strands
<br>and many dark strands like veins that are seen
<br>when a wing is lifted up.

Your hidden self is blood in those,
<br>those veins that are lute strings
<br>that make ocean music,
<br>not the sad edge of surf,
<br>but the sound of no shore.
