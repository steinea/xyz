Twenty-six attempts preceded the present genesis,
<br>all of which were destined to fail.
<br>The world of man has arisen out of the chaotic heart
<br>of the preceding debris; he too is exposed
<br>to the risk of failure, and the reutrn to nothing.
<br>‘Let us hope it works’ (Halway Sheyaamod)
<br>exclaimed God as he created the world,
<br>and this hope, which has accompanied the subsequent history
<br>of the world and mankind, has emphasized 
<br>right from the outset that this history is 
<br>branded with the mark of radical uncertainty. (Talmud)
