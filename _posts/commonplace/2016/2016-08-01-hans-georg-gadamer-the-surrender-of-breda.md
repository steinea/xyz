Gadamer writes about this painting in Truth and Method. The being of the original event comes to presence in the painting, because the event has a “pictorial quality” (i.e. its mode of being, as with all nature, is self-presentation) and is “performed like a sacrament”; the ceremony “need[s] to be” and “[is] suitable for being depicted” (149). The ceremony’s “being is … consummated in being represented in a picture” (149).
