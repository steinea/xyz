“Diana Jones Award-winning designer Eric Lang continues to release new games at a blistering pace since formally joining the team at CMON. His best effort this year is called Rising Sun, and it’s an absolute monster.

The spiritual successor to Blood Rage, Lang’s other hit miniatures-heavy game, Rising Sun earned more than $4.2 million on Kickstarter ahead of its release in 2018. Where Blood Rage had mechanical links to the classic area control game Risk, this fantastical Japanese-themed title owes more to Diplomacy. It’s a social experience, well-suited to groups who enjoy stabbing each other in the back.”
