"David Sims:"

"The hosts are confronting humanity with their own inhumanity."

"If Westworld is a show about evolving consciousness, then our hero is probably Bernard, a man with one foot in each reality, a host who’s played his part in controlling the other hosts and is now fighting to stay on the right side of survival."

"Spencer Kornhaber:"

"This sort of mayhem is exactly what humans come to Westworld for, but is it what we viewers come to Westworld for? And if we flinch more now that it’s humans in the crosshairs, is that hypocritical?"

"Is Dolores acting upon her own free will as she leads her man-made buddies in a quest to destroy mankind, both inside the park and out? Or is this genocide mission programmed? Ford may have sneakily led her to achieve the freedom of consciousness over the course of Season 1, but he also seemed to choreograph his demise at Dolores’s hand to coincide with the climax of the big toast he gave. Is she following his orders still? Or is her venom genuine?"

"As for the mysteries of the plot, it feels as though Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy winked at us viewers during the descent into that bunker. “I can tell you what this isn’t,” Charlotte said. “This isn’t me reading you in.” But maybe you picked up on some other clues, Sophie?"

"Sophie Gilbert: "

"The image from last season of two humanoid bodies posed like lovers has been replaced by the picture of a “woman” cradling a “child,” and the final Vitruvian man has been exchanged for a Vitruvian woman."

"For many thousands of years there was only one way to make life, until Delos found a new one. Arnold and Ford, the Prometheuses of Westworld’s founding mythology, sculpted life out of clay (or industrial-grade silicone, or whatever upgrades the future contains), and then gave their creations the tools that would advance their kind. "

"it’s interesting that the two hosts breaking free seem to be embodying the best and worst of humanity: the capacity for love, and the uglier desire for power."
