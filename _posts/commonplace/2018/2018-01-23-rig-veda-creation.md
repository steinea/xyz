HYMN CXXIX. Creation.

1 THEN was not non-existent nor existent: there was no realm of air, no sky beyond it.
<br>What covered in, and where? and what gave shelter? Was water there, unfathomed depth of water?
<br>2 Death was not then, nor was there aught immortal: no sign was there, the day's and night's divider.
<br>That One Thing, breathless, breathed by its own nature: apart from it was nothing whatsoever.
<br>3 Darkness there was: at first concealed in darkness this All was indiscriminated chaos.
<br>All that existed then was void and form less: by the great power of Warmth was born that Unit.
<br>4 Thereafter rose Desire in the beginning, Desire, the primal seed and germ of Spirit.
<br>Sages who searched with their heart's thought discovered the existent's kinship in the non-existent.
<br>5 Transversely was their severing line extended: what was above it then, and what below it?
<br>There were begetters, there were mighty forces, free action here and energy up yonder
<br>6 Who verily knows and who can here declare it, whence it was born and whence comes this creation?
<br>The Gods are later than this world's production. Who knows then whence it first came into being?
<br>7 He, the first origin of this creation, whether he formed it all or did not form it,
<br>Whose eye controls this world in highest heaven, he verily knows it, or perhaps he knows not.
