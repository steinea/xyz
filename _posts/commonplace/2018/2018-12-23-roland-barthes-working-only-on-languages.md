“working, as they themselves worked, only on languages, I unglue the text from its purpose as a guarantee: socialism, faith, evil. Whence (at least such is the theoretical intent of these studies) I force the displacement (but not to suppress; perhaps even to accentuate) of the text’s social responsibility” (“Preface,” 9)
