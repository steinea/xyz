"The game that took over the world by storm in 1993 does not exist anymore."

"the Northern Paladins people had the great idea to create a format emulating that era. Decks are 40 cards. Cards must be picked from the original edition. Max three of a rare. These rules are designed to replicate the set of cards available after purchasing a few starters. The result is the most fun format I have played in a very long time."
