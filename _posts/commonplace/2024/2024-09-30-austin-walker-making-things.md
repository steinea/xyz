"i have been trying to find some words for cohost's final days for about a week now. everything i write is self-serving and self-indulgent and a little too woeful. so here's the heart of it.

it's good to make things, even though making things is incredibly hard.

it's even better to make things that you believe in.

it's not a liberatory act that will save us ('evil people make things they believe in too'),

but making stuff does propel us forward, towards new intersections of thought and action

the alternative is entropy--real or abstract, and we live in a time where both have advocates

the latest and greatest developments of capitalism would prefer we made nothing, and that dare we make something, it better not be something we believe in for its own end.

exception: you are allowed to believe in a [product/service/brand's] abiltity to ['find an audience'/'create a niche'/generate profit]

but ideally, you don't even make a [product/service/brand]. you dropship a product that was made 5 years ago. you subcontract a service for pennies on the dollar. you leverage a brand built by following trends that you did not even need to organically understand.

soon, they dream: replace the 'you' with 'your ai agent of choice.'

it's good to make things, even though making things is incredibly hard.

it's even better to make things that you really, really believe in.

making things will not save us. but the alternative is creative annihilation.

and many people are rooting it to arrive."
