"no matter whether you like *Psychonauts 2*, or Double Fine as a studio, the very fact that they produced a 20+ hour docuseries showcasing the development of the game from its conception to its release is nothing short of a gift to an industry where developers are still routinely left out of credits for games they worked on."

"If you love the medium, you should want critics and developers alike to be able to produce their individual pieces of the artistic conversation without fear, be it financial or personal. If you want games to be better, you should stand not in opposition with developers and critics who love the medium, but in solidarity with them."
