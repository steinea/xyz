"The Dark Skies movement and the alarm raised in the Astronomic community about radio interference from Starlink are obviously conjoined. The planet including us is at risk losing terrestrial perceptual access to its surroundings.

Telescopes beyond LEO is clearly where things are heading but the C/B of beaming the web across borders and into rural areas (cool) weighed against losing direct sense of astronomic time and distance is not even close.

Perceptual access to space must be safeguarded as a species-level vocation, and yes this includes building the 30m telescope on Mauna Kea."
