"A wargame is a combination of 'game,' history and science. It is a paper time-machine. It usually combines a map, playing pieces representing historical personages or military units and set of rules telling you what you can or cannot do with them. The object of any wargame (historical or otherwise) is to enable the player to recreate a specific event and, more importantly, to be able to explore what might have been if the player decides to do things differently."
