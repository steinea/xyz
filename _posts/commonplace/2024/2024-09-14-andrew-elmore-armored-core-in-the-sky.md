"People always talk about Ace Combat like it's metal gear with planes or something when it is so very clearly Armored Core In The Sky. Why do you think they're the only two game franchises with the initials AC, you doofuses.

I heard you liked that V.IV Rusty, war buddy. Allow me to introduce you to roughly two dozen of that guys.

The reason that Mech Assault feels less like a mech game and more like an awkward third person shooter imo is the same reason Mech Warrior is decidedly a mech game isn't perspective, it's because piloting a mech in a video game should feel like a wildly dangerous dangerous responsibility to work.

That can come from any number of factors, but it's something Armored Core succeeds at without fail since the beginning, and Ace Combat gives me that exact same feeling."
