"I recently got hold of Geoffrey McKinney’s Carcosa Modules 5-8 (available [here](https://www.lulu.com/search?contributor=Geoffrey+McKinney&page=1&pageSize=10&adult_audience_rating=00)). I think these are among the best adventures I’ve ever read, but they have a particular “AD&D style” that isn’t really to my taste."

"So I have this impulse to take a key and edit it down [New Transparency](https://jared.blot.im/the-new-transparency) style."

"An excellent encounter, but somewhat buried under the prose. Here’s my (hastily) edited version, restatted for [TVG](http://thevanillagame.com/) because I’m a narcissist, probably."

> "0601

> Five giant snakes undulate across marshy ground and shallow water. Their 30’ bulk shares the mottled colors of the swamp. The faint green glow of their eyes continues for 1d20 days after death—the Lizard Men of the Rotting Carcass (0501) dare not approach those carrying a still-glowing eye.

> Giant Snake. HD 4. AC 2. Surprise 3-in-6. On hit, save vs death. A magic-user in possession of one or more of their eyes, freshly removed and still glowing, has +5 ST when attempting to control spells."
