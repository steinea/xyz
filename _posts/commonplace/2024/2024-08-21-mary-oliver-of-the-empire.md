"We will be known as a culture that feared death
<br>and adored power, that tried to vanquish insecurity
<br>for the few and cared little for the penury of the
<br>many. We will be known as a culture that taught
<br>and rewarded the amassing of things, that spoke
<br>little if at all about the quality of life for
<br>people (other people), for dogs, for rivers. All
<br>the world, in our eyes, they will say, was a
<br>commodity. And they will say that this structure
<br>was held together politically, which it was, and
<br>they will say also that our politics was no more
<br>than an apparatus to accommodate the feelings of
<br>the heart, and that the heart, in those days,
<br>was small, and hard, and full of meanness."
