"Solar radiation management is a technology, ocean fertilization is a technology, direct air carbon capture is set of technologies, but 'geoengineering' is not a technology.

It is a scale of effect of engineering intervention: those with climate significant effects.

Returning the Amazon to preindustrial footprint is geoengineering. Half Earth is geoengineering. Dark Skies is geoengineering.

Don't confuse the serious risks and trade-offs of a specific technology with the reality that the only effective responses to anthropogenic climate change will be equally anthropogenic."
