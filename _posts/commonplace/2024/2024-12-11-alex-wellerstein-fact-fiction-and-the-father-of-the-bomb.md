"Oppenheimer’s very public rise and fall, and his embodiment of various parables about dangerous knowledge (Faust, Prometheus, Icarus, etc.), have made his life one of the most scrutinized and publicized in the history of modern science."

"And yet, he is still universally described as inscrutable despite an extraordinary wealth of documentation"

"The best study of Oppenheimer’s use as a narrative figure is David K. Hecht’s 2015 book *Storytelling and Science: Rewriting Oppenheimer in the Nuclear Age*"

"Nolan wrote, directed, and produced *Oppenheimer*, explicitly basing it largely on the Pulitzer Prize–winning biography *American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer* (2005), written by Kai Bird and the late historian Martin J. Sherwin."

"What has resulted from that fascination is plainly a labor of love, both for Nolan and his leading actor, Cillian Murphy."

"According to [Nolan’s promotional interviews,](https://variety.com/2023/film/news/christopher-nolan-wrote-oppenheimer-script-first-person-1235633753/) the script was written exclusively in the first person—from Oppenheimer’s perspective—a remarkable and telling revelation about the questions Nolan was pursuing."

"Murphy’s Oppenheimer exudes tension, intelligence, and, crucially, insecurity. He is not portrayed as a hero, or someone you would want to emulate, or potentially even someone you would like to have dinner with. He is smart, yes, but he’s also a show-off, a know-it-all whose need to be considered “brilliant” by others drives him at times to be impressive, cruel, and thoughtless. It is remarkable that Nolan and Murphy went in this direction."

"One gets the sense that Nolan thinks Oppenheimer is important, and interesting, but not that he *likes* Oppenheimer."

"This may have helped him avoid the most seductive trap of all: trying to make Oppenheimer a relatable everyman."

"As a historian of nuclear weapons, I have been asked innumerable times since the film came out whether it was *accurate*. It is a harder question to answer than one might think."

"In *Oppenheimer*, many of the characters’ lines are in fact taken from historical documents, sometimes verbatim."

"The film also contains tricky mixtures of real and wholly imagined dialogue."

"More troublesome are the aspects of the film that are based on untrustworthy historical accounts. A terrific scene, which takes place just after Hiroshima, shows Oppenheimer giving a rousing and patriotic speech to a bloodthirsty crowd while internally haunted by thoughts of the burned and dead. It is the one place where Oppenheimer’s conflicting feelings toward Hiroshima are portrayed, and where what had happened at Hiroshima is imagined."

"the setup and dialogue were taken from a scientist’s recollections. But the scientist in question, Samuel Cohen, is [the *only* person who has ever indicated](https://www.hdssystems.com/Articles/ShameSamCohenFourthEdition2015.pdf) that this event happened, and he only wrote it down many decades after the fact."

"Cohen was a bit of a fabulist; he created an identity for himself as the [“father of the neutron bomb”](https://www.usni.org/press/books/berkeley-berlin) based on work he did on the possibilities of enhanced-radiation warheads at the RAND Corporation in the late 1950s, which actual weapons designers from the period regarded as fairly insignificant."

"Michael D. Gordin’s 2007 book [*Five Days in August: How World War II Became a Nuclear War*](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691168432/five-days-in-august) is a close account emphasizing just how rapidly attitudes on the atomic bomb changed in the days between its first use and the eventual surrender of Japan"

"The film is full of such questionably accurate scenes."

"is representing them as literal truth getting at a deeper truth, or introducing a deeper confusion? Does the ambivalence of historians about an event give the artist full latitude to present it either way?"

"the famous line from the Bhagavad Gītā that Oppenheimer later claimed flashed into his mind during the world’s first nuclear test, Trinity: “Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.”"

"Nolan’s film turns the quote into an orgasm, or a memory of an orgasm. There is something about this kind of transformation that I respect more than the subtler ones."

"Nolan is most editorial when he invents lines about Oppenheimer’s motivations and mental state and puts them into the mouths of observers"

"That Murphy’s character does not endorse or deny any of them is, I think, a plus: the film suggests them as possible interpretations but does not collapse the uncertainty into one definitive reality."

"Oppenheimer was much closer to the policy process during World War II than the film depicts, including in the targeting of the atomic bombs"

"The film’s implication of distance between Oppenheimer and the government officials involved in dropping the atomic bomb is inaccurate; they all saw eye to eye, and Oppenheimer personally endorsed the idea that the bombs ought be dropped on “urban areas” without warning."

"Oppenheimer’s views did not always carry the day, but one cannot really describe him as sidelined until Eisenhower became president in 1953, and then only because Strauss was made AEC chairman"

"One can see how this makes a less clean narrative about Oppenheimer and early nuclear policy, and one can see as well why Nolan probably felt that jumping from 1945 to 1949 worked better for an already long film."

"what does the director care about? Why make a film about Oppenheimer at all?"

"Nolan’s interest in Oppenheimer centers on two themes. One of them is the complexity of Oppenheimer’s character. The other is global destruction, threaded through the entire film from its first images until its last scene."

"The fact that these two themes are intertwined in the same person is, I think, the point."

"In Oppenheimer, the intensely personal is suffused with the apocalyptic imagination."

"Oppenheimer was, at this point, desperately trying to advocate for a world in which no nation would have nuclear weapons, using the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the nascent plans for even worse weapons, as an impetus for remaking the entire nature of war and international relations."

"He did not succeed; we live in his worst nightmare, where multiple states have civilization-killing quantities of nuclear arms ready for deployment at a moment’s notice."

"This harried, eschatological prophet, desperately trying to invoke what influence he has in order to convince the people with real power not to use that power poorly, is the Oppenheimer that Murphy channels, and that Nolan is interested in."

"I have always thought that Prometheus was the wrong reference point"

"Oppenheimer was no champion of humanity, and his punishment was not for having “stolen fire,” but for more mundane transgressions"

"In his Bhagavad Gītā reference, Oppenheimer renders himself as Prince Arjuna, who was cajoled by something great and terrible into taking on a burden he did not want."

"Even that feels incomplete, for while Oppenheimer was initially willing to go to war, he was afterwards gripped with an intense desire to push things in a different direction."

"Perhaps we need to invent a new, modern mythology for such a figure; perhaps that is what Nolan is really trying to do."
