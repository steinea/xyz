"What am I in most people's eyes? A nonentity, or an eccentric and disagreeable man---somebody who has no position in society and never will have, in short, the lowest of the low.

All right, then---even if that were absolutely true, then I should one day like to show by my work what such an eccentric, such a nobody, has in his heart.

This is my ambition, which is, in spite of everything, founded less on anger than on love, more on serenity than on passion.

Though I am often in the depths of misery, there is still calmness, pure harmony and music inside me. I see paintings or drawings in the poorest cottages, in the dirtiest corners. And my mind is driven toward these things with an irresistible force."
