> Mindy Seu's recipe for Cyberfeminism Index

> Ingredients: Database, Contributors, Designer, Editor, InDesign, Scripter, Publisher
>
> Description:
>
> First, define a canon of work that you would like to create an index of. Before beginning, check to see if other indexes or repositories already exist. It may be more useful to help maintain an existing list, rather than create a new one.
>
> Look at existing indexes and determine what is missing and which conventions you would like to break. Start by compiling a bibliography and a spreadsheet. Next, publish this individual resource online and create a submissions portal to allow others to contribute.
>
> As you bring on collaborators, create moderation guidelines. Give credit to the sources of material, whether they are "referred" by peers, or "submitted" online.
>
> Publish the index into a physical book. Creating books, no matter how small, is essential for world building.
