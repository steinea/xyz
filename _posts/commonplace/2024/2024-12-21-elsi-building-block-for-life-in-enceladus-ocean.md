"Using data collected by NASA’s Cassini mission, an international team of scientists including Tokyo Tech Earth-Life Science Institute researchers Yasuhito Sekine, Kento Furuya and Shuya Tan has discovered phosphorus – an essential chemical element for life – locked inside salt-rich ice grains ejected into space from Enceladus."

"Scientists found that Enceladus’ ice grains contain a rich array of minerals and organic compounds – including the ingredients for amino acids – associated with life as we know it."
