"Raymond Chandler (1888-1959) made detective fiction into a literary form.

He worked hard on his throwaway remarks, keeping lists of sharp comparisons, similes and gags.

Many of them never made into his works, but if they did, he marked them and added the title of the novel in which he used them."
