"The latest IPCC report made it clear that no new fossil fuel projects can be initiated if we are to avoid catastrophic global heating. Yet according to *Offshore Magazine*, a trade publication for offshore fossil fuel exploration, ‘the future is looking bright’. The sector is expected to expand by 14% this year alone."

"Tapping ‘unconventional’ deposits requires advanced technology. Before an offshore oil or gas well can be sunk, the area needs to be mapped, and the most accurate way to do that is via a process called ‘seismic exploration’."

"To penetrate the sub-seafloor, where oil and gas may be found, the blasts have to be extremely loud. At an unimaginable 240 decibels, they are among the loudest sounds humans can produce."

"experience sound in distinctive and complex ways (they are able to ‘see’ and feel with sound). Humans can hear frequencies between 20 and 20,000 hertz (Hz); Bottlenose dolphins can hear up to 160,000 Hz. They use their ultra-precise hearing to locate food, to navigate and to communicate. Hundreds of thousands of nuclear bomb-volume blasts ripping through their habitat is likely to affect their senses in ways we cannot understand. It is an act of phenomenal violence."

"What of the other inhabitants of the overfished, acidifying ocean? What happens when microorganisms are hit with a 240-decibel sound wave? The short answer is nobody knows; it hasn’t been adequately studied."

"Seismic exploration is a telling manifestation of the technoscientific reorganisation of global capital."

"It embodies the central contradiction that has been with us since the first nuclear explosions which opened a new epoch of [cybernetic capitalism](https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii135/articles/timothy-erik-strom-capital-and-cybernetics)."

"Cybernetic capitalism is compelled to seek new, ‘smart’ ways to achieve endless expansion, leaving behind a blasted sea and a boiling sky."
