"Thwump, whack, grunt, drip, smack, hit, sizzle. Can you hear the sexual tension? It’s the baseline sound of director Luca Guadagnino’s latest movie, Challengers"

"Guadagnino has served up the seemingly unimaginable. First, he’s made a sports film that actually works ... And second, he’s made the kind of old-fashioned romantic thriller, long absent from the cinemas"

Guadagnino: "'I like to see people in their wholeness and fragility,' he said in the interview with Waters. 'It’s interesting to see the nature, the naked truth of [what] we are made of'"
