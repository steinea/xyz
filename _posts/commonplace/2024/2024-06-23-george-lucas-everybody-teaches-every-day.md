"One of the basic concepts of human nature is personal responsibility. You either take responsibility for what you are doing, or you do not. But to deny that you have anything to with the world, that you don't influence it in any way is ridiculous. We all influence the world. We all teach. Some of us have larger voices than others, but everybody teaches every day of their lives. And everything you teach you are responsible for. I have a very loud voice and therefore I take it very seriously that whether you are influencing one person or a million people, the burden of responsibility still exists upon the individual."
