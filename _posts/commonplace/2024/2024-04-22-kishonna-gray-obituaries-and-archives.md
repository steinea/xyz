damita jo: "Obituaries are like history books. They are so valuable to future generations. I went through all the ones my grandmother had when she died in August and it was so grounding."

KishonnaGray: "Absolutely!! My granny and auntie send me the programs for every service... It's an honor to be a keeper of the archives of life!!"
