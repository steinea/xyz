Some interesting linkages I was not aware of, on Quora of all places, concluding with the mention of Dummett's work on the 'Frege-Husserl exchange' which led me to save this (post edited for clarity):

"I guess then that in Analytic Philosophy, the bridging has been done by those Philosophers who stumbled upon Hegel; I'm referring to the Pittsburgh School of Philosophy, who enlists Wilfrid Sellars (who said that his major work *Empiricism and Philosophy of Mind* were in fact Hegelian meditations), Richard Rorty (who bridges epistemology to hermeneutics in *Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature* and in various essays collected in *Consequences of Pragmatism* and *Essays on Heidegger and Others*; he also engaged very deeply with post-modernism, in the guise of Lyotard and Derrida, coming to strikingly close conclusions), John McDowell (Pittsburgh epistemologist whose *Mind and World* was defined by himself as propaedeutic to the reading of Hegel's *Phenomenology of Spirit*, and whose work drew fruitful epistemological and metaphysical comparisons of Sellars and Gadamer), and finally Robert Brandom, whose theory of Inferentialism defined in his masterpiece *Making It Explicit* is essentially a semantic reading of Hegel (Brandom is actually working on a book on Hegel's Phenomenology).

We have then other Analytic Philosophers whose work does not explicitly refers to Continental Philosophers, but can be thought as Analytic Philosophers arrived at 'Continental' conclusions. In epistemology they are of course Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend (especially the latter, he has nothing in common with the teleology of contemporary analytic philosophers such as Quine or Searle), Bas Van Fraassen (whose epistemology draws from the latter Wittgenstein to form a 'constructive empiricism' he also calls 'hermeneutic') ... Hilary Putnam then has been a reader of certain Continental Philosophers, such as Buber, Levinas and Habermas, and his later internal realism share some views with Rorty on the subjects of truth and knowledge. Michael Dummett has produced one of the most important researches in Analytic Philosophy by drawing its birth through a comparison of Frege's philosophy and Husserl's phenomenology"
