"instead of posts and beams making the rectilinear boxes “that have been the accepted basis of architecture since the beginning of shelter,” the visionary Fuller used tetrahedrons and octahedrons, shapes inspired by crystals and atoms, to create “lacy frameworks of the widest versatility.”"

"People called him a poet, a philosopher, a mathematician, an artist, an engineer, and a futurist"

"“A generalist known as the comprehensive designer,” says Alec Nevala-Lee in *Inventor of the Future*, his new biography. Fuller defined “comprehensive designer” as “an emerging synthesis of artist, inventor, mechanic, objective economist, and evolutionary strategist.”"

"when *Time* magazine featured him on its cover in 1964, he said, “I seem to be a verb, an evolutionary process—an integral function of the universe.”"
