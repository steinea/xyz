"I've come completely around on the whole notion. I don't ever wanna hear anybody say that writers shouldn't be directing... You have to be directing. I'm not interested in reading anybody else’s scripts anymore [who] aren't directing the film that they're writing. You should be making a film and showing it to me on the page.

I used to half-believe that and I used to sort of say it, but this experience has led me to be completely... I've gone completely shied on this at this point.

You could see people annoyingly like “oh the tracking shot takes him here" and then they get micro instead of writing, they get into that, but you've gotta see it, it's gotta be real. You gotta build it.

I can't tell you how much time I spent sketching, how much time I spend drawing. My god, the amount of sketches... And I'm not good. But you know, there's... “What's the room look like? How’s it laid out? Where are they gonna walk? Oh my God, if the thing is here and this is here, that's there, and it's like, My God, can you see them from here.”

You're trying to make something real."
