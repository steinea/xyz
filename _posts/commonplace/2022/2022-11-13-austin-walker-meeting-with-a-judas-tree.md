"Friends at the Table is currently gearing up to return to the Divine Cycle, which has effectively been an entire series built around self response around a self-critical inquiry. *COUNTER/Weight* opened with the argument that the giant mechs of fiction (and the technological and institutional inventions of humans) could have been built to look like anything, but were "made to look like us." *Twilight Mirage* scoffed at that, saying instead that when we thought we were "building mirrors," we were actually "setting fires," making things that were not only fundamentally unlike us, but also things that would outrun us, moving independently and far beyond our grasp. *PARTIZAN* counters back that it is naive to think we could ever build a culture that escapes our own gravitational pull, positing that we may be be unable to invent any form (cultural, technological, or otherwise) which lets us escape our worst tendancies and biases. What the hell is *PALISADE*, the next season in this long series, going to say back? Good question. Hopefully I'll know soon!"
