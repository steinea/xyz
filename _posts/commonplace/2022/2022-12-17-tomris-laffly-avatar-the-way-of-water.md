"*Avatar: The Way Of Water* not only delivers upon everything its predecessor established, but advances them in ways gleaming and ocean-deep, through the eyes and heart of a cinematic storyteller with a passionate and well-documented love of the sea"

"Indeed, what is *Titanic* if not, among its other themes, a humbling plunge into the wonder, danger, and power of the ocean? What’s *Abyss* or the 2014 National Geographic film *James Cameron’s Deepsea Challenge* if not the utmost proof of Cameron’s childlike awe of the planet’s bottomless depths?"

"the world of *The Way Of Water*—chiefly occupied by reef people called the *Metkayina Clan*—feels safe, cozy and comforting when compared to the stunning rainforest renderings of the first *Avatar,* which at first glance were hostile and dangerous for outsiders. And that makes sense, since water is also where Cameron himself is most content, most undeniably *at home*"
