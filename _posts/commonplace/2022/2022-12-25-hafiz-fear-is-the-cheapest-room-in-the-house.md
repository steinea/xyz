Fear is the cheapest room in the house
<br>I would like to see you living
<br>In better conditions,

For your mother and my mother
<br>Were friends.

I know the Innkeeper
<br>In this part of the universe.
<br>Get some rest tonight,
<br>Come to my verse tomorrow.
<br>We’ll go speak to the Friend together.

I should not make any promises right now,
<br>But I know if you
<br>Pray
<br>Somewhere in this world---
<br>Something good will happen.

God wants to see
<br>More love and playfulness in your eyes
<br>For that is your greatest witness to Him.

Your soul and my soul
<br>Once sat together in the Beloved’s womb
<br>Playing footsie.

Your heart and my heart
<br>Are very, very old
<br>Friends.
