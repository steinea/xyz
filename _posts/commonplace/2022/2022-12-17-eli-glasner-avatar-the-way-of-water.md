"This is the Cameron way, no concessions, no compromise — a wildly ambitious story which he sees as part of seven-film (!) cycle. A movie so expensive Cameron estimates it will need to earn $2 billion to break even."

""This family is our fortress," proclaims Jake in a line of dialogue that is pure Cameron — clunky but effective. But the decision to leave rather than fight marks a turning point for the film and Cameron as a storyteller."

"Beneath the special effects there's a fascinating contradiction at the heart of Cameron. A committed environmentalist, he's spent over a decade crafting a film about a world where species can plug into a Gaia-like planetary consciousness. But he's also the filmmaker who populates his film with "oorah"-hooting jarhead marines. The last third of the film is a tidal wave of testosterone as the marines attack the Metkayina with a massive flying fortress of a hovercraft which spits out whale-chasing boats, mini-subs and more."
