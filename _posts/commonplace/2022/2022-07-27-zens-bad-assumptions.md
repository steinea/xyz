things user/profile systems fuck up, bad assumptions

* the user will never delete their account
* the user should be expected to individually delete their posts
* the user will never change their legal name
* the user will never change their email address
* the user will never change their phone number
* if they do change those things, surely they will think to use our change info ui before getting rid of their old name/phone number/email address
* the same as above, but with SSO linkages
* the user will never die
* the user will never be arrested
* the user will never be subject to search and seizure
* the user will never want or need a copy of their data
* the user doesn’t need or want their data in any standard easily readable formats,
* some json or xml blob should be good enough right? that’s standard and readable, right?
* the user wishes to have their identity be immutable and persistent - that is to say, continue to be associated with old posts , analytics data and content regardless of the number of name and identifying info changes, thanks to “helpful” permafingerprint algorithms tracking the user across identity changes.
* the user will never have a stalker, an abusive ex, or angry internet mob
* the user probably doesn’t mind having their full legal name and list of postal addresses listed on the public web a google searcg away. i mean, it’s public data right? information wants to be free dude. you can just unregister to vote if you don’t like it.
* the user database will never be hacked or leaked: this one is interesting from the perspective of: if you start from the assumption your user database definitely will be leaked: what design decisions do you make differently
* These 6 things are different things, not the same thing. they do not require each other nor are they required by each other: identity, security, persistence, reputation, privacy, ownership.
* the user doesn’t care if their profile is indefinitely indexed by search engines by any and every old name they have ever had.
* the user is definitely some binary gender
* that gender is definitely something you need to collect
* that gender will never change
* you can enumerate all the possible genders without leaving anyone out
* the user is fine with a permanent and immutable URL being generated from their full name.
