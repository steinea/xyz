"Can audiences still be wowed, given the constant torrent of wide-screen spectacle? And are there new delights to be discovered in the alien world of Pandora, all these years after the [original *Avatar*](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/09/avatar-2-movie-james-cameron/671578/)?"

"*The Way of Water* only enlarges *Avatar*’s refreshing skepticism about the human race; almost every character in the film is Na’vi now, and there’s no need for a *Dances With Wolves*–style story arc of our hero falling in love with a new culture"

"Cameron’s achingly sincere approach"
