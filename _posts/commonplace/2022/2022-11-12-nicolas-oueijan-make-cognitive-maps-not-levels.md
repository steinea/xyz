How to understand our cognitive map: <em>The Image of the City</em> by Kevin Lynch

* Paths
* Landmarks
* Districts
* Edges
* Nodes

<em>Path</em>

What:

* A linear space that directs movement/travel
* Tends to be dominant in CM

Examples:

* Sidewalks
* Streets
* Trails

How to identify:

* Travel tends to be concentrated on them
* Most temporal element

Features:

* Relies on continuity, proprioception, calculation, or intuition

Uses:

* Guiding players quickly to a destination
* Catching lost players
* Establishing player flow in a level
* Connecting large areas


<em>Landmark</em>

What:

* A single, localized, and memorable feature
* Point-References

Examples:

* Towers
* Statues
* Founations

How to identify:

* Tend to be objects/structures
* Things you might think to take a picture of
* Recognizable visually/narratively/experientially

Uses:

* Most useful element when journey becomes less familiar
* Orient players from a distance (if visible)
* Situate elements of the level among themselves


<em>District</em>

What:

* A region identifiable by characteristic or quality
* Zonal/Area reference

Examples

* Industrial Zones
* Downtowns
* Nature Preserves

How to identify:

* "Squint" tests
* Has edges - "Go Through"
* Mid-Large scale
* Color-by-number
* In a "Place with a place," it's usually the bigger place

Uses:

* Groups of things like other things are easier to remember than random groups of things
* Clusters can be semantic, or mechanic, not just visual
* Helps definie unique identity of a space


<em>Edge</em>

What:

* Linear non-paths that indicate, separate, or control continuity

Examples:

* Gates/Walls
* Cliffs
* Borderlines
* Doors, Apertures
* Tunnel openings
* Paved -> Non-paved

How to identify:

* Tend to be elevational
* "Go around/along"
* Thresholds you cross through between places

Uses:

* Level transitions
* Level boundaries
* Mechanical boundaries
* Portals
* Ledges/Walls/Cliffs etc


<em>Node</em>

What:

* Convergence of paths
* Point-References

Examples:

* Traffic intersections
* Transit hubs
* "Home" spaces

How to identify:

* Many "Ins" or "Outs
* Denser activity than adjacent areas
* Strategically placed in or between districts
* Branching milestones when traveling along paths

Uses:

* Re-use/revisit multiple times
* Place-making
* Nodes can be destinations
* Good nodes can be experienced "in" not just "through"
* Make/spend more time here


<em>Implementation</em>

1. Audit

* Identify existing Paths, Landmarks, Districts, Edges, and Nodes
* Assess their clarity and readability

2. Organize

* Draw your level's plan using only these elements. Is is clear, readable?
* Draw your level's section using only these elements. Is is moving, emotional?

<em>Plan is structure, Section is emotion.</em>
