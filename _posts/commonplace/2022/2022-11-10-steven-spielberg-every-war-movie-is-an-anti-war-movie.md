Filmmakers and critics have long [debated](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20140710-can-a-film-be-truly-anti-war) whether it is possible to make an “anti-war movie.” French director Francois Truffaut argued in 1973 that simply depicting war [glorifies it](https://www.theringer.com/movies/2020/1/29/21112768/war-movies-1917-dunkirk-saving-private-ryan-apocalypse-now), so every war film is inevitably pro-war. Steven Spielberg, who directed *Saving Private Ryan*, claimed [the opposite](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/01/-em-lone-survivor-em-s-takeaway-every-war-movie-is-a-pro-war-movie/282812/): “Every war movie, good or bad, is an anti-war movie.” Francis Ford Coppola sided with Truffaut and [argued](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/09/francis-ford-coppola-apocalypse-now-is-not-an-anti-war-film) that *Apocalypse Now*, which many consider to be one of the greatest anti-war movies ever filmed, isn’t an anti-war film.
