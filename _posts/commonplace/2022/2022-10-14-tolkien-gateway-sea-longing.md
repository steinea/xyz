""*The Sea! Alas! I have not yet beheld it. But deep in the hearts of all my kindred lies the sea-longing, which it is perilous to stir. Alas! for the gulls. No peace shall I have again under beech or under elm.*""

"**Sea-longing**, or the **Unquiet of [Ulmo](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Ulmo)**"

"The [Noldor](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Noldor) who lingered in [Middle-earth](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Middle-earth) had an unquietable yearning for the Sea, coupled with their nostalgia of [their home](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Eldamar)"
