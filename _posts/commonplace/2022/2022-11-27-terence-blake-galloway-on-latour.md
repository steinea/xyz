"One of the most important modes of existence for Latour is that of REL, or the religious mode of existence. Latour invokes Jan Assmann’s MOSES THE EGYPTIAN to describe how REL detached itself from MET, the polytheistic metamorphic mode of existence.This is an event of ontological scale for Latour."

"He further describes, devoting a whole book to it (REJOICING), how once again REL has almost disappeared from the contemporary world."

"Latour is obviously a post-modern thinker, in Lyotard’s sense of the incredulity towards legitimating meta-narratives. Galloway’s superficial attempt to attribute « one particular grand narrative, systematicity » to Latour is belied by Latour’s explicit deconstruction of his own burgeoning systematicity in AN INQUIRY INTO MODES OF EXISTENCE."

"Latour takes his distance from the paralysing relativism of the network paradigm and seeks a pluralist realism that culminates, for the moment, in AIME."
