"Guy Debord was, I think, pretty unironically obsessed with Clausewitz the military theorist, and also Napoleon, he was obsessed with Hegel, he was sort of interested in a kind of heroic, glorious form of militancy."

"I sort of see this as a way in which Debord allowed network thinking, and the new network age that was growing up around him in the 70s and 80s, and it's a throwback to Napoleon and the logistic notion of a logistical supply line on the battlefield, but I also see it as a kind of simple way of thinking about networks and allowing that kind of post-Fordist network, economic thinking to create this game that we can maybe informally call *chess with networks*."

"It's a nostalgic algorithm."
