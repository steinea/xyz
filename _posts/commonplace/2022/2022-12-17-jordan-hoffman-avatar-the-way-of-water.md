"many viewers will have a vexing experience if they see the picture in what’s considered the optimum format"

"Jake and Neytiri’s family becomes a collective fish out of water, almost literally, moving in with an aquatic tribe of Na’vi and adapting to their aquatic lifestyle. This is where Cameron’s rich soak in his invented world is most fulfilling. There’s about an hour of just floatin’ around the local reef"

"The changes mean that the tempo of the action on screen looks either sped up or slowed down as the switches occur. Shots in higher frame rate couched between ones that are lower (and there are many) look like a computer game that gets stuck on a render, which then spits something out super fast"

"It’s just fascinating that Captain Technology, James Cameron, would *want* it this way. And it’s unfortunate"
