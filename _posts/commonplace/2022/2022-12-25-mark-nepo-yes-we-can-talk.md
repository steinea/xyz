Having loved enough and lost enough,
<br>I'm no longer searching
<br>just opening,

no longer trying to make sense of pain
<br>but trying to be a soft and sturdy home
<br>in which real things can land

These are the irritations
<br>that rub into a pearl

So we can talk for awhile
<br>But then we must listen,
<br>the way rocks listen to the sea.

And we can churn at all that goes wrong
<br>but then we must lay all distractions
<br>down and water every living seed.

And yes, on nights like tonight
<br>I too feel alone. But seldom do I
<br>face it squarely enough
<br>to see that it's a door
<br>into the endless breath
<br>that has no breather,
<br>into the surf that human
<br>shells call God.
