When Albert Murray said
<br>the second law adds up to
<br>the blues that in other words
<br>ain’t nothing nothing he meant it

not quite the way my pops says
<br>nomads don’t show emotions
<br>but more how my grandmother
<br>warned that men like women

with soft hands blood red
<br>nails like how Mingus meant
<br>truth if  you had time for it
<br>facts if  you got no time that

years pass. Zero
<br>one two three and
<br>the man you used

to flirt with you can
<br>no longer flirt with
<br>thank goodness.

He’s now a man
<br>you can’t wear
<br>your  jaw out on

about weather
<br>news or work

a perfect
<br>strawberry

buried
<br>beneath

a peck.
