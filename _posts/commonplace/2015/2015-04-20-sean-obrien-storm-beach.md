It feels like an achievement, emptiness
<br>Reorganized to make the matter plain.
<br>In the long pool trapped behind the shingle bank
<br>The sky is blue and bitter. 
<br>Amstel cratesAnd ragged scalps of weed have likewise
<br>Been reconsidered, while the sea
<br>Has gone somewhere as if for good:
<br>No distance has been spared
<br>And the horizon is revealed as yet another
<br>Obsolescent form of measurement,
<br>Leaving only the sublime 
<br>By which to take a sun-blind bearing.
<br>It’s freezing when we stroll onstage—
<br>We find the rake is steeper now— 
<br>As if at last we ought to broach
<br>The fundamentals wisely put aside
<br>Long since in weatherproof compartments
<br>For such a day as this. 
<br>But instantly it’s clear
<br>That ours will not be speaking parts.
<br>The gulls will do all that. In this austerity
<br>Of blazing salt-charged air and stunned geology
<br>We’re only here to represent the crowd
<br>Who cross and go to do the greeting
<br>And the mourning, further on and further out.
