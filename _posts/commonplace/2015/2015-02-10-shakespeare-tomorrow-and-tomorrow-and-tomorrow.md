"She should have died hereafter;
<br>There would have been a time for such a word.
<br>— To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,
<br>Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
<br>To the last syllable of recorded time;
<br>And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
<br>The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
<br>Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
<br>That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
<br>And then is heard no more. It is a tale
<br>Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury
<br>Signifying nothing."

— Macbeth (Act 5, Scene 5, lines 17-28)
