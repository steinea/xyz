"Atop a pedestal sits an imposingly futuristic cube made of inch-thick Lucite, enclosing several computer circuit boards. It is designed to latch onto the gallery’s Internet connection and create a secure Wi-Fi hot spot, anonymizing all traffic over the Tor Network while simultaneously turning the gallery itself into a Tor relay point, to aid others across the globe in anonymizing their connections. Even if your involvement is as low-impact as selecting the “Autonomy Cube” network when it comes up on your smartphone, you become a small part of the fight for Internet privacy."
