"Internally enhanced by electronic memory aids, we might manage to look quite normal from a distance, but only by becoming a different species: technologically reconstituted humans."

"How people feel and what moves them becomes vastly more important than what they can remember. People who cannot follow a story or read a book can be deeply moved by music or dance, by physical feeling and the lingering memories it evokes. In contrast to Descartes’s cold rationality, Heidegger’s vital sense of our ‘being-in-the-world’ embraces our being moved by the world, by fear and joy."
