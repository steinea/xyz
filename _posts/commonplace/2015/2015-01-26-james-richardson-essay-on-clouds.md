Maybe a whale,
<br>as Hamlet mused, or a camel or weasel,
<br>more likely a hill,

or many hills (with clouds,
<br>as with us, true singletons are rare).
<br>Mostly we compare them

to silent things, sensing
<br>that thunder is something else
<br>that gets into them—a stone, a god—

and, as for what they want to say,
<br>aeromancy, which presumed to interpret,
<br>never caught on. After all,

clouds weren’t reliable predictors
<br>even of rain, and if they had a message
<br>for us, we guessed,

it would hardly be practical:
<br>clouds are not about
<br>about, showing instead

boundless detail without specificity.
<br>Whales, sure (which might in turn be
<br>blue clouds), but we don’t say

How very like a screwdriver,
<br>or my house, or my uncle, or certainly
<br>how unlike my uncle. For though a blend

of winds we don’t at our level
<br>necessarily feel lends them
<br>amazing motion, that’s not the same as

intention, so failure
<br>is not in question. We wouldn’t say
<br>That cloud is derivative, jejune,

disproportionate, strained, in the wrong place,
<br>or (since they affirm nothing)
<br>That cloud is wrong,

though truly they often bear down
<br>on exactly the wrong moment—that overcast,
<br>is it one cloud or ten thousand

that makes everything feel so gray
<br>forever? From inside, of course—think
<br>of flying through one—

a cloud has no shape. As with us: only
<br>when someone looks hard, or we catch
<br>our reflections, do we solidify as

whale
<br>weasel
<br>fool

and plummet. Large clouds can weigh
<br>more than a 747, yet not one
<br>has ever crashed, so admirably

do they spread their weight, a gift
<br>it is not too much to hope
<br>we could possess, since according to Porchia

we are clouds: If I were stone
<br>and not cloud, my thoughts,
<br>which are wind, would abandon me. O

miracle not miraculous! Everything
<br>we know well
<br>lightens and escapes us, and isn’t that

when we escape? So, just as
<br>Old and Middle English clūd
<br>meant rock or hill, but now

means cloud, really I mean
<br>in exactly the same way that stone
<br>got over being stone

and rose, we rise.
