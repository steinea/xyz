"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the LORD: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people. And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, ‘Know the LORD,’  for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the LORD . For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more." 

31:33-34
