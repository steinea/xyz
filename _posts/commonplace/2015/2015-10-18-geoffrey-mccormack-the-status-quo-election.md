"Despite stagnation, from the standpoint of capital, the Conservative Party has competently managed economic affairs. The NDP and Liberal Party, for all their criticisms, have offered few compelling alternatives. Since all three major parties are devoted to capitalism, it is unsurprising that the policies they propose remain technocratic and tepid."

Years of lackluster capital accumulation, coupled with stagnant employment rates and sputtering output growth, are taking their toll on the Canadian working class."
