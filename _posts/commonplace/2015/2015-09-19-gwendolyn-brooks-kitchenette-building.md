We are things of dry hours and the involuntary plan,
<br>Grayed in, and gray. “Dream” makes a giddy sound, not strong
<br>Like “rent,” “feeding a wife,” “satisfying a man.”

But could a dream send up through onion fumes
<br>Its white and violet, fight with fried potatoes
<br>And yesterday’s garbage ripening in the hall,
<br>Flutter, or sing an aria down these rooms

Even if we were willing to let it in,
<br>Had time to warm it, keep it very clean,
<br>Anticipate a message, let it begin?

We wonder. But not well! not for a minute!
<br>Since Number Five is out of the bathroom now,
<br>We think of lukewarm water, hope to get in it.
