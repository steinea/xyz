We can walk anywhere and we can stop at some new café where we don’t know anyone and nobody knows us and have a drink.” 

“We can have two drinks.” 

“Then we can eat somewhere.” 

“No. Don’t forget we have to pay the library.” 

“We’ll come home and eat here and we’ll have a lovely meal and drink Beaune from the co- operative you can see right out of the window there with the price of the Beaune on the window. And afterwards we’ll read and then go to bed and make love.” 

“And we’ll never love anyone else but each other.” 

“No. Never.” 


A Moveable Feast, Chapter 3.
