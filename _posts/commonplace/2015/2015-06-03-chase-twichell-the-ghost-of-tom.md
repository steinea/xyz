At family gatherings,
<br> a Family Friend liked gathering
<br> the girls to make us sing rounds.

We always wanted the spooky one,
<br> Have you seen the ghost of Tom?
<br> Long white bones with the rest all gone ...

We’d substitute words, like long white boners

with the rest all gone,
<br> which he pretended not to hear

because who knows, any one of us
<br> might blow his cover at any minute,

unpredictable little liars that we were,
<br> the girl cousins, talking preteen trash
<br> about him, the things he likes to do,

for example gather the girl cousins
<br> and make them sing against their wills.

His personal favorite was 
<br> Tender Shepherd, tender Shepherd,

Let me help you count your sheep.
<br> One in the meadow, two in the garden,

Three in the nursery, fast asleep.

One Christmas there were only 
<br> three of us, so we sang 

the round with one part missing.
<br> I still listen to the fourth part —

that’s the real ghost.
