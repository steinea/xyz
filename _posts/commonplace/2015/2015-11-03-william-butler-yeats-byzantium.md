The unpurged images of day recede; 
<br>The Emperor's drunken soldiery are abed; 
<br>Night resonance recedes, night-walkers' song 
<br>After great cathedral gong; 
<br>A starlit or a moonlit dome disdains 
<br>All that man is, 
<br>All mere complexities, 
<br>The fury and the mire of human veins. 

Before me floats an image, man or shade, 
<br>Shade more than man, more image than a shade; 
<br>For Hades' bobbin bound in mummy-cloth 
<br>May unwind the winding path; 
<br>A mouth that has no moisture and no breath 
<br>Breathless mouths may summon; 
<br>I hail the superhuman; 
<br>I call it death-in-life and life-in-death. 

Miracle, bird or golden handiwork, 
<br>More miracle than bird or handiwork, 
<br>Planted on the starlit golden bough, 
<br>Can like the cocks of Hades crow, 
<br>Or, by the moon embittered, scorn aloud 
<br>In glory of changeless metal 
<br>Common bird or petal 
<br>And all complexities of mire or blood. 

At midnight on the Emperor's pavement flit 
<br>Flames that no faggot feeds, nor steel has lit, 
<br>Nor storm disturbs, flames begotten of flame, 
<br>Where blood-begotten spirits come 
<br>And all complexities of fury leave, 
<br>Dying into a dance, 
<br>An agony of trance, 
<br>An agony of flame that cannot singe a sleeve. 

Astraddle on the dolphin's mire and blood, 
<br>Spirit after spirit! The smithies break the flood, 
<br>The golden smithies of the Emperor! 
<br>Marbles of the dancing floor 
<br>Break bitter furies of complexity, 
<br>Those images that yet 
<br>Fresh images beget, 
<br>That dolphin-torn, that gong-tormented sea.
