I

Around them boomed the rhetoric of time,
<br>The smells and furniture of the known world
<br>Where conscience worshipped an aesthetic order
<br>And what was unsuccessful was condemned;
<br>And, at the centre of its vast self-love,
<br>The emperor and his pleasures, dreading death.

In lovely verse that military order,
<br>Transferring its obsession onto time,
<br>Besieged the body and cuckolded love;
<br>Puzzling the boys of an atheletic world,
<br>These only feared another kind of Death
<br>To which the time-obsessed are all condemned.

Night and the rivers sang a chthonic love,
<br>Destroyer of cities and the daylight order,
<br>But seemed to them weak arguments for death;
<br>The apple tree that cannot measure time
<br>Might taste the apple yet not be condemned;
<br>They, to enjoy it, must renounce the world.

Friendly to what the sensual call death,
<br>Placing their lives below the dogs who love
<br>Their fallen masters and are not condemned,
<br>They came to life within a dying order;
<br>Outside the sunshine of its civil world
<br>The savage waited their appointed time.

Its brilliant self-assertions were condemned
<br>To interst the forest and draw death
<br>On aqueducts and learning; yet the world,
<br>Through them, had witnessed, when predestined love
<br>Fell like a daring meteor into time,
<br>The condescension of eternal order.

So, sown in little clumps about the world,
<br>The fair, the faithful and the uncondemned
<br>Broke out spontaneously all over time,
<br>Setting against the random facts of death
<br>A ground and possibility of order,
<br>Against defeat the certainty of love.

And never, like its own, condemned the world
<br>Or hated time, but sang until their death:
<br>"O Thou who lovest, set its love in order."

Quite suddenly her dream became a word:
<br>There stood the unicorn, declaring - "Child";
<br>She kissed her dolls good-bye and one by one
<br>Embraced the faithful roses in the garden,
<br>Waved for the last time to her mother's home,
<br>And tiptoed out into the silent forest.

And seemed the lucky, the predestined one
<br>For whom the stones made way without a word;
<br>And sparrows fought to make her feel at home,
<br>And winds restrained their storms before the child;
<br>And all the children of that mother-forest
<br>Were told to let her treat it as her garden.

Till she forgot that she was not at home
<br>Where she was loved, of course, by everyone,
<br>Could always tell the rose-bush - "Be a forest."
<br>Or make dolls guess when she had thought a word,
<br>Or play at being Mother in the garden
<br>And have importance as her only child.

So, scampering like a sparrow through the forest,
<br>She piled up stones, pretending they were Home,
<br>Called the wild roses that she picked "My Garden,"
<br>Made any wind she chose the Naughty One,
<br>Talked to herself as to a doll, a child
<br>Whose mother-magic knew the Magic Word.

And took the earth for granted as her garden:
<br>Till the day came the children of the forest
<br>Ceased to regard or treat her as a child;
<br>The roses frowned at her untidy home,
<br>The sparrows laughed when she misspelt a word,
<br>Winds cried:"A mother should behave like one."

Frightened and cruel like a guilty child,
<br>She shouted all the roses from her garden,
<br>And threw stones at the winds: without a word
<br>The unicorn slipped off into the forest
<br>Like an offended doll, and one by one
<br>The sparrows flew back to her mother's home.

Of course the forest overran her garden,
<br>Yet, though, like everyone, she lost her home,
<br>The Word still nursed Its motherhood, Its child.

If one could name the father of these things,
<br>They would not happen to decide one's fate:
<br>He woke one morning and the verbal truth
<br>He went to bed with was no longer there;
<br>The years of reading fell away; his eyes
<br>Beheld the weights and contours of the earth.

One must be passive to conceive the truth:
<br>The bright and brutal surfaces of things
<br>Awaited the decision of his eyes,
<br>These pretty girls, to be embraced by fate
<br>And mother all the objects of the earth;
<br>The fatherhood of knowledge stood out there.

One notices, if one will trust one's eyes,
<br>The shadow cast by language upon truth:
<br>He saw his role as father to an earth
<br>Whose speechless, separate, and ambiguous things
<br>Married at his decision; he was there
<br>To show a lucid passion for their fate.

One has good reason to award the earth
<br>The dog-like dumb devotion of the eyes;
<br>Death, love, dishonour are predicted there,
<br>Her arbitrary moments are the truth;
<br>No, he was not the father of his fate;
<br>The power of decision lay with things.

To know, one must decide what is not there,
<br>Where sickness is, and nothing: all that earth
<br>Presented was a challenge to his fate
<br>To father dreams of talking oaks, of eyes
<br>In walls, catastrophes, sins, poems, things
<br>Whose possibilities excluded truth.

What one expects is not, of course, one's fate:
<br>When he had finished looking at them, there
<br>Were helpless images instead of things
<br>That had looked so decided; instead of earth
<br>His fatherless creation; instead of truth
<br>The luckiest convention of his eyes:

That saw himself there with an exile's eyes
<br>Missing his Father, a thing of earth
<br>On whose decision hung the fate of truth.

Castle and crown are faded clean away,
<br>The fountain sinks into a level silence;
<br>What kingdom can be reached by the occasions
<br>That climb the broken ladders of our lives?
<br>We are imprisoned in unbounded spaces,
<br>Defined by an indefinite confusion.

We should have wept before these occasions,
<br>We should have given what is snatched away;
<br>O columns, acrobats of cheering spaces,
<br>O songs that were the royal wives of silence,
<br>Now you are art and part of our confusion;
<br>We are at loggerheads with our own lives.

The order of the macrocosmic spaces,
<br>The outward calm of their remote occasions,
<br>Has lost all interest in our confusion;
<br>Our inner regimen has given way;
<br>The subatomic gulfs confront our lives
<br>With the cold stare of their eternal silence.

Where are the kings who routed all confusion,
<br>The bearded gods who shepherded the spaces,
<br>The merchants who poured gold into our lives?
<br>Where the historic routes, the great occasions?
<br>Laurel and language wither into silence;
<br>The nymphs and oracles have fled away.

And cold and absence echo on our lives:
<br>"We are your conscience of your own confusion
<br>That made a stricken widow of the silence
<br>And weeping orphans of the unarmed spaces,
<br>That laid time waste behind you, stole away
<br>The birthright of innumerable occasions."

O blessing of reproach. O proof that silence
<br>And condemnation presuppose our lives:
<br>We are not lost but only run away,
<br>The authors and the powers of confusion;
<br>We are the promise of unborn occasions;
<br>Our presence is required by all the spaces.

The flora of our lives could guide occasions
<br>Without confusion on their frisking way
<br>Through all the silences and all the spaces.
