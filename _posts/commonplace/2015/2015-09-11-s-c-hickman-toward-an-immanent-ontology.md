"“Bring something incomprehensible into the world!” — Gilles Deleuze (A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia)"

"Nick Srnicek tells us that this “work holds interest to me insofar as he defines religion in terms of a belief in transcendence. The history of secularization, therefore, is the story of the emergence of immanence over time.”"

"Srnicek is a bonafide member of that new breed of thinker who questions the humanistic post-Kantian traditions in political, religious, secular, and philosophical thought as it pertains to our grasp of the Real, which has emerged under the – not so tranquil – umbrella of speculative realism."

"He quotes Deleuze who defines assemblages as a text that produces real material effects, rather than solely transmitting information: “An assemblage, in its multiplicity, necessarily acts on semiotic flows, material flows, and social flows simultaneously (independently of any recapitulation that may be made of it in a scientific or theoretical corpus). There is no longer a tripartite division between a field of reality (the world) and a field of representation (the book) and a field of subjectivity (the author). Rather, an assemblage establishes connections between certain multiplicities drawn from each of these orders, so that a book has no sequel nor the world as its object nor one or several authors as its subject. In short, we think that one cannot write sufficiently in the name of an outside. The outside has no image, no signification, no subjectivity. The book as assemblage with the outside, against the book as image of the world.”"

"In his essay, The Problem of Individuation, he clarifies his stance regarding the concept of individuation and its importance telling us that the only way to face the “irreducible complexity of the social world” is to meet it head on “by understanding the relational network within which individuals emerge as constituted subjects, objects and systems” then we can “say that our concepts grasp real things”"
