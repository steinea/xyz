What you did wasn’t so bad.
<br>You stood in a small room, waiting for the sun.
<br>At least you told yourself that.
<br>I know it was small,
<br>but there was something, a kind of pulped lemon,
<br>at the low edge of the sky.

No, you’re right, it was terrible.
<br>Terrible to live without love
<br>in small rooms with vinyl blinds
<br>listening to music secretly,
<br>the secret music of one’s head
<br>which can’t be shared.

A dream is the only way to breathe. 
<br>But you must
<br>find a more useful way to live.
<br>I suppose you’re right 
<br>this was a failure: to stand there
<br>so still, waiting for—what?

When I think about this life,
<br>the life you led, I think of England, 
<br>of secret gardens that never open,
<br>and novels sliding off the bed
<br>at night where the small handkerchief
<br>of darkness settles over
<br>one’s face.
