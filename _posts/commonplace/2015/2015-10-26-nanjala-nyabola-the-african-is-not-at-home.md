"Africans are not at home everywhere in Africa. We are just as unhomed and othered here – as migrants, refugees, internally displaced persons – as we are anywhere else, a fact that is important to recognise if we are to move away from empty platitudes about solidarity and actually start building just and equitable societies."

"The problem is that this casual distillation of African identity irrevocably binds African identity to something external, mainly land."
