*Variation on a Line from Elizabeth Bishop’s “Five Flights Up”*

Sometimes it’s the shoes, the tying and untying,
<br>the bending of the heart to put them on,
<br>take them off, the rush of blood
<br>between the head and feet, my face,
<br>sometimes, if I could see it, astonished.
<br>Other times the stairs, three, four stages
<br>at the most, “flights” we call them,
<br>in honor of the wings we’ll never have,
<br>the fifth floor the one that kills the breath,
<br>where the bird in the building flies to first.
<br>Love, too, a leveler, a dying all its own,
<br>the parts left behind not to be replaced,
<br>a loss ongoing, and every day increased,
<br>like rising in the night, at 3:00 am,
<br>to watch the snow or the dead leaf fall,
<br>the rings around the streetlight in the rain,
<br>and then the rain, the red fist in the heart
<br>opening and closing almost without me.
<br>“ — Yesterday brought to today so lightly!”
<br>The morning, more and more, like evening.
<br>When I bend to tie my shoes and the blood
<br>fills the cup, it’s as if I see into the hidden earth,
<br>see the sunburned path on which I pass
<br>in shoes that look like sandals
<br>and arrive at a house where my feet
<br>are washed and wiped with my mother’s hair
<br>and anointed with the autumn oils of wildflowers.
