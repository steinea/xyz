"Neoliberalism has made the individual into the most important unit of society, and we progressives have more or less taken the bait. We spend a lot of time arguing that these few positions should be filled with the most representative of people possible, which they should be. But this assumes that there is broad consensus among feminists and anti-racist activists of what that representation looks like and who that representation is. Or, that liberation is tied to representation in otherwise oppressive structures."
 
"But winning access to The National is a neoliberal victory. A single person who represents an alternative opinion to the status quo, up against two pundits who virtually have the same position, is hardly something to celebrate."
