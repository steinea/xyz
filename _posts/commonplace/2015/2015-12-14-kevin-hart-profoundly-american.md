"Calvin is a modern, concerned with “revelation” (rather than illumination, as the Fathers were, or apocalypsis, uncovering, as the writers of the New Testament were) and with knowing what God is like rather than what sort of being God is."
 
"The given is “lawful,” and also “emergent”"

"Shakespeare’s plays show us, we are told, how characters become “entangled” (one of Robinson’s favorite words) with one another and with what drags human beings down, and how their relationships unfold in time and circumstance, bringing occasions for self-awareness (and, one might add, further self-deception)."

"a sneer is not an argument"
 
"I regret that, in this hasty survey of a hundred and 50 years of demanding literature, philosophy, and theology, no distinctions are drawn, and not one name or book title is given. Who actually is guilty here? The trouble is that without appropriate care one might very well condemn everything written by Fichte, Hegel, Hermann Cohen, Husserl, and Simone Weil, among others, rather than, as I imagine Robinson has in mind, passages in Schopenhauer, Gentile, and Wagner, Heidegger’s notebooks, and Frege’s diary, to name only a few of the most well-known nasty moments of ideas that rightly should be condemned."
