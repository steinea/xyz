On the stiff twig up there
<br>Hunches a wet black rook
<br>Arranging and rearranging its feathers in the rain.
<br>I do not expect a miracle
<br>Or an accident

To set the sight on fire
<br>In my eye, nor seek
<br>Any more in the desultory weather some design,
<br>But let spotted leaves fall as they fall,
<br>Without ceremony, or portent.

Although, I admit, I desire,
<br>Occasionally, some backtalk
<br>From the mute sky, I can't honestly complain:
<br>A certain minor light may still
<br>Lean incandescent

Out of kitchen table or chair
<br>As if a celestial burning took
<br>Possession of the most obtuse objects now and then --
<br>Thus hallowing an interval
<br>Otherwise inconsequent

By bestowing largesse, honor,
<br>One might say love. At any rate, I now walk
<br>Wary (for it could happen
<br>Even in this dull, ruinous landscape); skeptical,
<br>Yet politic; ignorant

Of whatever angel may choose to flare
<br>Suddenly at my elbow. I only know that a rook
<br>Ordering its black feathers can so shine
<br>As to seize my senses, haul
<br>My eyelids up, and grant

A brief respite from fear
<br>Of total neutrality. With luck,
<br>Trekking stubborn through this season
<br>Of fatigue, I shall
<br>Patch together a content

Of sorts. Miracles occur,
<br>If you care to call those spasmodic
<br>Tricks of radiance miracles. The wait's begun again,
<br>The long wait for the angel,
<br>For that rare, random descent.
