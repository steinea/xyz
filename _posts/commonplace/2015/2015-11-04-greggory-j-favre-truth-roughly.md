"The impersonation of first responders is a well-documented tactic for malicious actors. Seemingly “official-looking” individuals can use the ruse to conduct an attack, perform surveillance, or facilitate escape. In my case, last week, the entire uniform that I presented to the guard could be purchased online for roughly $300. This tactic works because of the social norms around perceived authority figures and the impact that simple human intuition has on decision-making. From the moment I approached the building, I was surrounded by millions of dollars in technological and physical security measures. The overwhelming majority of the building is subject to around-the-clock, off-site surveillance. There are hundreds of cameras, control zones, and armed guards. And I strolled past the main checkpoint in the name of professional courtesy. Quite simply, to the guard I encountered, I looked the part. A well-designed, multi-layered security system, compromised by the imperfect assumptions of human trust."

"In Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle argued that there is no one path to a good life. While his students pleaded for a formula or specific rules or a guarantee, the great teacher simply noted, “We shall be satisfied to indicate the truth roughly and in outline… [seeking exactness] to the extent that the nature of the subject allows.”"
