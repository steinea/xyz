Over the growing shadows fell the dead weight of  light.

With a long bark mules metered the distance and turned back.
<br>Dust rose like columns of unpaid debt.
<br>Spit dried before it could reach the ground.

Then the thin-barked orange trees disowned their thick-skinned fruit.
<br>Then mosquitoes spat out bad blood into the gutters and were gone. 

Fish was opened like a two-page book,
<br>its skeleton, caught aflame like an asp,
<br>inscribed with fire along the bone lines,
<br>then slapped on a stone face of a plate 
<br>next to a Coca-Cola bottle as cold as hell.

In the market fruit prices jumped up so high — 
<br>the seller women turned into hawks.

With a gibbous peacock brushing by their feet,
<br>in the woods where each leaf  hides a face,
<br>                          and each trunk a spine,
<br>                                                 and each tree a crime,
<br>                                                               where owls and angels,

a man and three women were contesting an apple.

The winner’s body itself was an apple with skin chewed off.
<br>Inside her breasts milk circled like a growling animal
<br>locked behind two heavy nipples.

It was both day and night.
<br>Her moon-white hand on the sun-gold fruit.
<br>In her hair more stones than in a graveyard.

So

    I followed the woman as she ate
<br>    hoping if not for a bite
<br>    then at least
<br>    a spit in my direction.
<br>    But she left nothing of that apple.
<br>    Not even the memory of eating it

    ever.
