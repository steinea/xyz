Deep the waters of the Black Pool, colored like ink;
<br>They say a Holy Dragon lives there, whom men have never seen.
<br>Beside the Pool they have built a shrine; the authorities have established a ritual;
<br>A dragon by itself remains a dragon, but men can make it a god.
<br>Prosperity and disaster, rain and drought, plagues and pestilences—
<br>By the village people were all regarded as the Sacred Dragon’s doing.
<br>They all made offerings of sucking-pig and poured libations of wine;
<br>The morning prayers and evening gifts depended on a “medium’s” advice.

   When the dragon comes, ah!
   <br>The wind stirs and sighs
   <br>Paper money thrown, ah!
   <br>Silk umbrellas waved.
   <br>When the dragon goes, ah!
   <br>The wind also—still.
   <br>Incense-fire dies, ah !
   <br>The cups and vessels are cold.

Meats lie stacked on the rocks of the Pool’s shore;
<br>Wine flows on the grass in front of the shrine.
<br>I do not know, of all those offerings, how much the Dragon eats;
<br>But the mice of the woods and the foxes of the hills are continually drunk and sated.

   Why are the foxes so lucky?
   <br>What have the sucking-pigs done,

That year by year they should be killed, merely to glut the foxes?
<br>That the foxes are robbing the Sacred Dragon and eating His sucking-pig,
<br>Beneath the nine-fold depths of His pool, does He know or not?
