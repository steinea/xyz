“The “last judgment’ as the ultimate revelation of the shape of personality, the image in the heart on the body drawn, is always going on because it is eternal. To the watching angel the presentation of a self is in everyday life where we are being visibly created by our imaginings, which means we are not a product of external forces, not what we do or choose, not what we have stocked in inventory, nor does it matter in that ultimate revelation whether our imaginings proceed via intuition or extraversion or feeling. We are being judged in our images, which gives to the image and all our imaginings an extraordinary moral importance.”
