XXVII. 

How yesterday is long ago! The past
<br>Is a fixed infinite distance from to-day,
<br>And bygone things, the first-lived as the last,
<br>In irreparable sameness far away.
<br>How the to-be is infinitely ever
<br>Out of the place wherein it will be Now,
<br>Like the seen wave yet far up in the river,
<br>Which reaches not us, but the new-waved flow!
<br>This thing Time is, whose being is having none,
<br>The equable tyrant of our different fates,
<br>Who could not be bought off by a shattered sun
<br>Or tricked by new use of our careful dates.
<br>This thing Time is, that to the grave-will bear
<br>My heart, sure but of it and of my fear.
