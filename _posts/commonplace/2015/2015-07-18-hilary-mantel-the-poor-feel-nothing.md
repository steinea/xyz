"‘An equal chance? It seems against nature.’ 

‘Other nations conduct themselves differently. Look at England. You can’t say it’s a human trait, to be oppressed.’ 

‘Oppressed? Is that what you think you are?’ 

‘I feel it; and if I feel it, how much more do the poor feel it?’ 

‘The poor feel nothing,’ the Prince said. ‘Do not be sentimental. They are not interested in the art of government. They only regard their stomachs.’ 

‘Even regarding just their stomachs –’ 

‘And you,’ Condé said, ‘are not interested in the poor–oh, except as they furnish you with arguments. You lawyers only want concessions for yourselves.’"

A Place of Greater Safety, p. 37
