"Perhaps. This word orients two of this episode’s key conversations: Margaery’s with Loras, and Varys’s with Tyrion. And if you had to boil The Wars to Come down to a simple tension, it would be this: prophecy vs. perhaps. This is the tension within the show, as those who believe in the inevitable (the witch, Stannis, perhaps Daenerys) prepare to variously engage with those (Margaery, Varys, Jon Snow) who apparently do not. But it’s also the tension for those of us watching the show. This is the season when what’s written and what’s still to be made coexist, in tantalizing tension with each other."
