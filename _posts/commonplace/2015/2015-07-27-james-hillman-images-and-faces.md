“Not only is each person an image and this image is his invisible divinity presented, but each particular aspect of a person is a face, each face an image, this dream and this symptom, this behaviour and this desire, is also a distinct image, a tale condensed into a depiction, a visibility that needs no interpreted meaning, gives no certain feeling, a vortex that expands and so1idifies a cluster of multiplicities rushing through it.”
