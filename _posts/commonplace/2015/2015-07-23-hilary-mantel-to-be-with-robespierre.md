"To be with Robespierre, Camille had to put on gravity like a winter cloak. ‘He is all I should be,’ he told Lucile. ‘Max doesn’t care for failure or success, it all evens out in his mind. He doesn’t care what other people say about him, or what opinion they hold of his actions. As long as what he does feels right, inside, that’s enough for him, that’s his guide. He’s one of the few men, the very few men, to whom only the witness of their own conscience is necessary.’"

A Place of Greate Safety, pg. 277
