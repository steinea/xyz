"What does the crowd want? To roar. Its wider objectives? No coherent answer. Ask it: it roars. Who are these people? No names. The crowd just wants to grow, to embrace, to weld together, to gather in, to melt, to bay from one throat . . . .Â A mob has no soul, it has no conscience, just paws and claws and teeth."

A Place of Greater Safety, pg. 219
