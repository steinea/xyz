670 ("One need not be a Chamber—to be Haunted—")
 by Emily Dickinson (1830-1886)  

One need not be a Chamber—to be Haunted— 
<br> One need not be a House— 
<br> The Brain has Corridors—surpassing 
<br> Material Place— 

Far safer, of a Midnight Meeting 
<br> External Ghost 
<br> Than its interior Confronting— 
<br> That Cooler Host. 

Far safer, through an Abbey gallop, 
<br> The Stones a'chase— 
<br> Than Unarmed, one's a'self encounter— 
<br> In lonesome Place— 

Ourself behind ourself, concealed— 
<br> Should startle most— 
<br> Assassin hid in our Apartment 
<br> Be Horror's least. 

The Body—borrows a Revolver— 
<br> He bolts the Door— 
<br> O'erlooking a superior spectre— 
<br> Or More—
