There are the rushing waves
<br>mountains of molecules
<br>each stupidly minding its own business
<br>trillions apart
<br>yet forming white surf in unison 

Ages on ages
<br>before any eyes could see
<br>year after year
<br>thunderously pounding the shore as now.
<br>For whom, for what?
<br>On a dead planet
<br>with no life to entertain. 

Never at rest
<br>tortured by energy
<br>wasted prodigiously by the Sun
<br>poured into space.
<br>A mite makes the sea roar. 

Deep in the sea
<br>all molecules repeat
<br>the patterns of one another
<br>till complex new ones are formed.
<br>They make others like themselves
<br>and a new dance starts.
<br>Growing in size and complexity
<br>living things
<br>masses of atoms
<br>DNA, protein
<br>dancing a pattern ever more intricate. 

Out of the cradle
<br>onto dry land
<br>here it is
<br>standing:
<br>atoms with consciousness;
<br>matter with curiosity. 

Stands at the sea,
<br>wonders at wondering: I
<br>a universe of atoms
<br>an atom in the Universe.
