I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree, 
<br>And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made; 
<br>Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee, 
<br>And live alone in the bee-loud glade. 

And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow, 
<br>Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings; 
<br>There midnight’s all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow, 
<br>And evening full of the linnet’s wings. 

I will arise and go now, for always night and day 
<br>I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore; 
<br>While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey, 
<br>I hear it in the deep heart’s core.
