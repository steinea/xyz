Though the fig tree should not blossom,
<br>    nor fruit be on the vines,
<br>the produce of the olive fail
<br>    and the fields yield no food,
<br>the flock be cut off from the fold
<br>    and there be no herd in the stalls,

yet I will rejoice in the Lord;
<br>    I will take joy in the God of my salvation.

God, the Lord, is my strength;
<br>    he makes my feet like the deer's;
<br>    he makes me tread on my high places.

<br>

To the choirmaster: with stringed[a] instruments.
