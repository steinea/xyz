"Simply put these are three pages of longhand, stream of consciousness writing done first thing in the morning. Unlike journaling you simply write out, without censure, whatever thoughts came to mind. Good, bad, ugly, or indifferent. The point, according to Cameron, is to “catch yourself before your ego’s defenses are in place.” The primary function of this “brain dump” is to begin the process of removing the angry, whiny, petty worries that cloud your thinking so that they don’t accompany you throughout the day. The content simply doesn’t matter, what’s important is getting your thoughts out of your head and onto the page. You can write about absolutely anything, from small frustrations to your deepest fears or just a good ol’ fashioned angry tirade."
