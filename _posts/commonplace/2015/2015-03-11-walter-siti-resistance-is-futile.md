"a wonderfully ambiguous author's note: "To avoid ambiguity or misunderstanding, I warn the reader that, just as the protagonist of these Conversations is not the author, so the Sicily in which his story takes place is Sicily only by chance, because I like the sound of the word 'Sicily' better than 'Persia' or 'Venezuela.' As for the rest, I imagine all manuscripts are found in a bottle.""
