XXIII.

Even as upon a low and cloud-domed day,
<br>When clouds are one cloud till the horizon,
<br>Our thinking senses deem the sun away
<br>And say «'tis sunless» and «there is no sun»;
<br>And yet the very day they wrong truth by
<br>Is of the unseen sun's effluent essence,
<br>The very words do give themselves the lie,
<br>The very thought of absence comes from presence:
<br>Even so deem we through Good of what is evil.
<br>He speaks of light that speaks of absent light,
<br>And absent god, becoming present devil,
<br>Is still the absent god by essence' right.
<br>The withdrawn cause by being withdrawn doth get
<br>(Being thereby cause still) the denied effect.
