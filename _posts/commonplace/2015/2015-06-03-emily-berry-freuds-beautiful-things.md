*A cento*

I have some sad news for you
<br>I am but a symbol, a shadow cast on paper
<br>If only you knew how things look within me at the moment
<br>Trees covered in white blossom
<br>The remains of my physical self
<br>Do you really find my appearance so attractive?
<br>Darling, I have been telling an awful lot of lies lately
<br>If only I knew what you are doing now?
<br>Standing in the garden and gazing out into the deserted street?
<br>Not a mermaid, but a lovely human being
<br>The whole thing reminds me of the man trying to rescue a birdcage from the burning house
<br>(I feel compelled to express myself poetically) 
<br>I am not normally a hunter of relics, but ...
<br>It was this childhood scene ...
<br>(My mother ... )
<br>All the while I kept thinking: her face has such a wild look
<br>... as though she had never existed
<br>The fact is I have not yet seen her in daylight
<br>Distance must remain distance
<br>A few proud buildings; your lovely photograph
<br>I find this loss very hard to bear
<br>The bells are ringing, I don’t quite know why
<br>What makes all autobiographies worthless is, after all, their mendacity
<br>Yesterday and today have been bad days
<br>This oceanic feeling, continuous inner monologues
<br>I said, “All the beautiful things I still have to say will have to remain unsaid,” and the writing table flooded
