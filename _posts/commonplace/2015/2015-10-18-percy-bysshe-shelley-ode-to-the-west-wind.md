I
<br>O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn's being,
<br>Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead
<br>Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing,

Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,
<br>Pestilence-stricken multitudes: O thou,
<br>Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed

The wingèd seeds, where they lie cold and low,
<br>Each like a corpse within its grave, until
<br>Thine azure sister of the Spring shall blow

Her clarion o'er the dreaming earth, and fill
<br>(Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air)
<br>With living hues and odours plain and hill:

Wild Spirit, which art moving everywhere;
<br>Destroyer and Preserver; hear, O hear! 
 
II
Thou on whose stream, 'mid the steep sky's commotion,
<br>Loose clouds like Earth's decaying leaves are shed,
<br>Shook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean,

Angels of rain and lightning: there are spread
<br>On the blue surface of thine airy surge,
<br>Like the bright hair uplifted from the head

Of some fierce Maenad, even from the dim verge
<br>Of the horizon to the zenith's height,
<br>The locks of the approaching storm. Thou dirge

Of the dying year, to which this closing night
<br>Will be the dome of a vast sepulchre
<br>Vaulted with all thy congregated might

Of vapours, from whose solid atmosphere
<br>Black rain, and fire, and hail will burst: O hear!
 
 
III
<br>Thou who didst waken from his summer dreams
<br>The blue Mediterranean, where he lay,
<br>Lulled by the coil of his crystalline streams,

Beside a pumice isle in Baiae's bay,
<br>And saw in sleep old palaces and towers
<br>Quivering within the wave's intenser day,

All overgrown with azure moss and flowers
<br>So sweet, the sense faints picturing them! Thou
<br>For whose path the Atlantic's level powers

Cleave themselves into chasms, while far below
<br>The sea-blooms and the oozy woods which wear
<br>The sapless foliage of the ocean, know

Thy voice, and suddenly grow grey with fear,
<br>And tremble and despoil themselves: O hear!
 
 
IV
<br>If I were a dead leaf thou mightest bear;
<br>If I were a swift cloud to fly with thee;
<br>A wave to pant beneath thy power, and share

The impulse of thy strength, only less free
<br>Than thou, O Uncontrollable! If even
<br>I were as in my boyhood, and could be

The comrade of thy wanderings over Heaven,
<br>As then, when to outstrip thy skiey speed
<br>Scarce seemed a vision; I would ne'er have striven

As thus with thee in prayer in my sore need.
<br>Oh! lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud!
<br>I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed!

A heavy weight of hours has chained and bowed
<br>One too like thee: tameless, and swift, and proud.
 
 
V
<br>Make me thy lyre, even as the forest is:
<br>What if my leaves are falling like its own!
<br>The tumult of thy mighty harmonies

Will take from both a deep, autumnal tone,
<br>Sweet though in sadness. Be thou, Spirit fierce,
<br>My spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one!

Drive my dead thoughts over the universe
<br>Like withered leaves to quicken a new birth!
<br>And, by the incantation of this verse,

Scatter, as from an unextinguished hearth
<br>Ashes and sparks, my words among mankind!
<br>Be through my lips to unawakened Earth

The trumpet of a prophecy! O Wind,
<br>If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?
