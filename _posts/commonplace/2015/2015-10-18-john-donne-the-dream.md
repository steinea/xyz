Elegies
X. The Dream

IMAGE of her whom I love, more than she,
<br>Whose fair impression in my faithful heart
<br>Makes me her medal, and makes her love me,
<br>As kings do coins, to which their stamps impart
<br>The value; go, and take my heart from hence,
<br>Which now is grown too great and good for me.
<br>Honours oppress weak spirits, and our sense
<br>Strong objects dull; the more, the less we see.
<br>When you are gone, and reason gone with you,
<br>Then fantasy is queen and soul, and all;
<br>She can present joys meaner than you do,
<br>Convenient, and more proportional.
<br>So, if I dream I have you, I have you,
<br>For all our joys are but fantastical;
<br>And so I ’scape the pain, for pain is true;
<br>And sleep, which locks up sense, doth lock out all.
<br>After a such fruition 1 I shall wake,
<br>And, but the waking, nothing shall repent;
<br>And shall to love more thankful sonnets make,
<br>Than if more honour, tears, and pains were spent.
<br>But, dearest heart and dearer image, stay;
<br>Alas! true joys at best are dream 2 enough;
<br>Though you stay here, you pass too fast away,
<br>For even at first life’s taper is a snuff.
<br>Fill’d with her love, may I be rather grown
<br>Mad with much heart, than idiot with none.
