*A Double Sestina*

Strephon. 
<br>Ye Goatherd gods, that love the grassy mountains,
<br>Ye nymphs which haunt the springs in pleasant valleys,
<br>Ye satyrs joyed with free and quiet forests,
<br>Vouchsafe your silent ears to plaining music,
<br>Which to my woes gives still an early morning,
<br>And draws the dolor on till weary evening. 

Klaius. 
<br>O Mercury, foregoer to the evening,
<br>O heavenly huntress of the savage mountains,
<br>O lovely star, entitled of the morning
<br>While that my voice doth fill these woeful valleys,
<br>Vouchsafe your silent ears to plaining music,
<br>Which oft hath Echo tired in secret forests. 

Strephon. 
<br>I that was once free burgess of the forests,
<br>Where shade from Sun, and sport I sought in evening,
<br>I, that was once esteemed for pleasant music,
<br>Am banished now among the monstrous mountains
<br>Of huge despair, and foul affliction's valleys,
<br>Am grown a screech-owl to myself each morning. 

Klaius. 
<br>I that was once delighted every morning
<br>Hunting the wild inhabiters of forests,
<br>I, that was once the music of these valleys
<br>So darkened am, that all my day is evening,
<br>Heart-broken so, that molehills seem high mountains,
<br>And fill the vales with cries instead of music. 

Strephon. 
<br>Long since alas, my deadly swannish music
<br>Hath made itself a crier of the morning
<br>And hath with wailing strength climbed highest mountains;
<br>Long since my thoughts more desert be than forests,
<br>Long since I see my joys come to their evening,
<br>And state thrown down to over-trodden valleys. 

Klaius. 
<br>Long since the happy dwellers of these valleys
<br>Have prayed me leave my strange exclaiming music,
<br>Which troubles their day's work, and joys of evening;
<br>Long since I hate the night, more hate the morning;
<br>Long since my thoughts chase me like beasts in forests,
<br>And make me wish myself laid under mountains. 

Strephon. 
<br>Meseems I see the high and stately mountains
<br>Transform themselves to low dejected valleys;
<br>Meseems I hear in these ill-changed forests
<br>The nightingales do learn of owls their music;
<br>Meseems I feel the comfort of the morning
<br>Turned to the mortal serene of an evening. 

Klaius. 
<br>Meseems I see a filthy cloudy evening
<br>As soon as sun begins to climb the mountains;
<br>Meseems I feel a noisome scent, the morning
<br>When I do smell the flowers of these valleys;
<br>Meseems I hear, when I do hear sweet music,
<br>The dreadful cries of murdered men in forests. 

Strephon.
<br>I wish to fire the trees of all these forests;
<br>I give the sun a last farewell each evening;
<br>I curse the fiddling finders-out of music;
<br>With envy I do hate the lofty mountains
<br>And with despite despise the humble valleys;
<br>I do detest night, evening, day, and morning. 

Klaius. 
<br>Curse to myself my prayer is, the morning;
<br>My fire is more than can be made with forests,
<br>My state more base than are the basest valleys;
<br>I wish no evenings more to see, each evening;
<br>Shamed, I hate myself in sight of mountains
<br>And stop mine ears, lest I grow mad with music. 

Strephon. 
<br>For she, whose parts maintained a perfect music,
<br>Whose beauties shined more than the blushing morning,
<br>Who much did pass in state the stately mountains,
<br>In straightness passed the cedars of the forests,
<br>Hath cast me, wretch, into eternal evening
<br>By taking her two suns from these dark valleys. 

Klaius. 
<br>For she, with whom compared, the Alps are valleys,
<br>She, whose least word brings from the spheres their music,
<br>At whose approach the sun rose in the evening,
<br>Who, where she went, bare in her forehead morning,
<br>Is gone, is gone from these our spoiled forests,
<br>Turning to deserts our best pastured mountains. 

Strephon. 
<br>These mountains witness shall, so shall these valleys,

Klaius.
<br>These forests eke, made wretched by our music,

Both.
<br>Our morning hymn this is, and song at evening.
