"President Obama called a mass shooting in California this week “an act of terrorism designed to kill innocent people.”"

"Obama said that investigators do not believe the killers “were directed by a terrorist organization overseas or that they were part of a broader conspiracy here at home.”"

"“But it is clear that the two of them had gone down the dark path of radicalization, embracing a perverted interpretation of Islam that calls for war against America and the West,” he said."

"The attack appeared to have been carefully orchestrated. Farook and Malik wore masks and military-style vests and used assault rifles and handguns—some they had purchased legally, others they had reportedly gotten from someone else."
