"This is why there can be two forms of despair in the strict sense. If a human self had itself established itself, then there could be only one form: not to will to be oneself, to will to do away with oneself, but there could not be the form: in despair to will to be oneself."

"This second formulation is specifically the expression for the complete dependence of the relation (of the self), the expression for the inability of the self to arrive at or to be in equilibrium and rest by itself, but only, in relating itself to itself, by relating itself to that which has established the entire relation."

"Yes, this second form of despair (despair to will to be oneself) is so far from designating merely a distinctive kind of despair that, on the contrary, all despair ultimately can be traced back to and be resolved in it."

....

"The misrelation of despair is not a simple misrelation by a misrelation in a relation that relates itself to itself and has been established by another, so that the misrelation in that relation which is for itself [for sig] also reflects itself infinitely in the relation to the power that established it."

"The formula that describes the state of self when despair is completely rooted out is his: in relating itself to itself and willing to be itself, the self rests transparently in the power that established it."
