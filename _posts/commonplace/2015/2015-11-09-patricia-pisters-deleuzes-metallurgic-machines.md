"This concept of ecology as a triple enfolding of the environmental, the social, and the mental that always belong together (but again, not always through straightforward, causal connections) is developed by Guattari; as a rhizomatic “ecosophy” it can also be found everywhere in A Thousand Plateaus."

"Deleuze, while gesturing a “Z” pattern in the air, indicates that the zigzag is actually an originary movement. Not only does it bring him back to the letter A, and the zigzag patterns of the trajectory of the fly and other animals discussed in the letter A, it is also the elementary movement of the creation of a thought, a world, and even the universe: it is the zigzagging movement of lightning that makes one see how things connect (“l’éclair qui fait voir”)."
