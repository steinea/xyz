I wonder which ones I will remember:
<br>That I loved my boyfriendâ€™s best friend?
<br>That I rode the lonely train to Boston?
<br>That I could never hold myself together?
<br>Maybe I should just tell them
<br>Milk was $2.89 a gallon and bread was $3.29
<br>And an iPhone was $200
<br>In 2010, when I was 22.
