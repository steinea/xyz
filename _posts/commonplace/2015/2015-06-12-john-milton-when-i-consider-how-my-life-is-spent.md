When I consider how my light is spent,
<br>Ere half my days in this dark world and wide,
<br>And that one talent which is death to hide
<br>Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent
<br>To serve therewith my Maker, and present
<br>My true account, lest He returning chide;
<br>"Doth God exact day-labor, light denied?"
<br>I fondly ask. But Patience, to prevent
<br>That murmur, soon replies, "God doth not need
<br>Either man's work or His own gifts. Who best
<br>Bear His mild yoke, they serve Him best. His state
<br>Is kingly: thousands at His bidding speed,
<br>And post o'er land and ocean without rest;
<br>They also serve who only stand and wait."
