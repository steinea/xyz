"To touch the edge of a theory, to talk about forces and dimensions and vibrating energy, is beautiful and fearful, the kind of fear that is good, like fearing God."

"There is a striking idea in modern physics that other dimensions do in fact exist, and that there is knowledge of them because theorists have taken what I — and a number of them, it seems — would construe as a leap of faith. Apparently, there might be as many as seven possible dimensions, and these seven, as my brother puts it, interact in a way similar to the sacrament of communion; that is, they engage between the observable and the unseen, making possible, at least theoretically, the reality of transubstantiation."

"What I like about theoretical physics is what I like about the work of Joy Williams. I absorb the sentences, process the dynamics, follow the dialogue, and then, somewhere during the reading, I lose the edge of what I thought I understood"
