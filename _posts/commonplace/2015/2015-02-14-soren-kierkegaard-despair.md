A. Despair is the sickness unto death 

   I. Despair is a sickness of the spirit, of the self, and accordingly can take three forms:

      1. In despair not to be conscious of having a self (not despair in the strict sense)
      2. In despair not to will to be oneself
      3. In despair to will to be oneself

XI 127, The Sickness Unto Death, p. 13
