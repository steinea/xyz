"They confuse life stage differences and generational differences. They’ll look at the fairly predictable changes that happen over someone’s life—when you’re starting off, you’re not very attached and don’t have a spouse, a child, a mortgage—and they will often say, ‘Oh this generation is so much different.’ That often is not true, and it’s one of the lessons we keep on having to relearn."

"Every new generation is much better at using the new technology than previous ones. You can almost define them based on what the current technology was when they came of age."

"Millennials want to have reliable, good, accurate, and consistent feedback. You can say that is being needy, but lots of other people would like to have good feedback as well."

"The Millennials are really the first generation that have entered the labor market with zero—and I mean zero—illusions about what they can expect."
