*Haibun*

Who are the ones who awake without hearing 
the sound of the sun-filled 
clouds 
dancing upon the edges of an outstretched wing? 
And who am I? 
To stand alone like a swordsman 
without his sword, 
a mere figure 
in the unresolved distance 
like a brushstroke 
awaiting a scroll— 
an empty bowl 
ungrateful for the pleasure 
of its emptiness 

—from Rattle #47, Spring 2015
 Tribute to Japanese Forms
 2016 Neil Postman Award Winner


Jack Vian: “For the incarcerated poet, a poem is more than just a literary construct, it is an ideal given flesh. It’s the difference in wishing that a passing plane will notice the ship-wrecked castaways, and taking the time to carve an SOS in the beach or put a message in a bottle. So I’m always thankful when readers find something worthwhile in my experience. The only Japanese form that I use regularly is the haiku, and my practice of that had fallen into arrears. But I wrote this highly versified almost-haibun while reading a biography of Miyamoto Musashi.”
