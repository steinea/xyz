"Strategists will tell you that it is a mistake to fight the battle your enemies want you to fight. You should impose your strategy on them, not let them impose theirs on you. These lessons apply to the struggle with the leaders of ISIS. We have applied pressure upon them in Syria; they have replied with atrocious attacks in Ankara, Beirut, and now Paris. They are trying to provoke an apocalyptic confrontation with the Crusader infidels. We should deny them this opportunity."
 
"Destroying the ISIS project to establish a caliphate will not put an end to jihadi nihilism, but it will decisively erode ISISâ€™s ideological allure. A successful campaign against nihilism will have to resist nihilism itself."
