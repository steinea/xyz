XXI. 

Thought was born blind, but Thought knows what is seeing.
<br>Its careful touch, deciphering forms from shapes,
<br>Still suggests form as aught whose proper being
<br>Mere finding touch with erring darkness drapes.
<br>Yet whence, except from guessed sight, does touch teach
<br>That touch is but a close and empty sense?
<br>How does mere touch, self-uncontented, reach
<br>For some truer sense's whole intelligence?
<br>The thing once touched, if touch be now omitted,
<br>Stands yet in memory real and outward known,
<br>So the untouching memory of touch is fitted
<br>With sense of a sense whereby far things are shown
<br>So, by touch of untouching, wrongly aright,
<br>Touch' thought of seeing sees not things but Sight.
