Your hands lie open in the long fresh grass,— 
<br>   The finger-points look through like rosy blooms: 
<br>   Your eyes smile peace. The pasture gleams and glooms 
<br>'Neath billowing skies that scatter and amass. 
<br>All round our nest, far as the eye can pass, 
<br>   Are golden kingcup fields with silver edge 
<br>   Where the cow-parsley skirts the hawthorn-hedge. 
<br>'Tis visible silence, still as the hour-glass. 

Deep in the sun-searched growths the dragon-fiy 
<br>Hangs like a blue thread loosened from the sky:— 
<br>   So this wing'd hour is dropt to us from above. 
<br>Oh! clasp we to our hearts, for deathless dower, 
<br>This close-companioned inarticulate hour 
<br>   When twofold silence was the song of love.
