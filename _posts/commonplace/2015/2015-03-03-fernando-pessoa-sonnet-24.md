XXIV. 

Something in me was born before the stars
<br>And saw the sun begin from far away.
<br>Our yellow, local day on its wont jars,
<br>For it hath communed with an absolute day.
<br>Through my Thought's night, as a worn robe's heard trail
<br>That I have never seen, I drag this past
<br>That saw the Possible like a dawn grow pale
<br>On the lost night before it, mute and vast.
<br>It dates remoter than God's birth can reach,
<br>That had no birth but the world's coming after.
<br>So the world's to me as, after whispered speech,
<br>The cause-ignored sudden echoing of laughter.
<br>That 't has a meaning my conjecture knows,
<br>But that 't has meaning's all its meaning shows.
