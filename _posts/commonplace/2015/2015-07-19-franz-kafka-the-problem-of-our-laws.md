"The laws after all are so old, centuries have worked on their interpretation, even their interpretation has in a sense become codified, and while there is surely room still for interpretation, it will be quite limited."

"the nobility has no reason to bend the law against us, if only because the laws were in their favour from the very beginning, the nobility being outside the law, and that is why the laws seem to have been given exclusively into their hands."

"the laws we try to guess at donâ€™t exist at all"

"if any law exists, then its form can only possibly be: the law is what the nobility do"

"arbitrary acts on the part of the nobility"
