XXV. 

We are in Fate and Fate's and do but lack
<br>Outness from soul to know ourselves its dwelling,
<br>And do but compel Fate aside or back
<br>By Fate's own immanence in the compelling.
<br>We are too far in us from outward truth
<br>To know how much we are not what we are,
<br>And live but in the heat of error's youth,
<br>Yet young enough its acting youth to ignore.
<br>The doubleness of mind fails us, to glance
<br>At our exterior presence amid things,
<br>Sizing from otherness our countenance
<br>And seeing our puppet will's act-acting strings.
<br>An unknown language speaks in us, which we
<br>Are at the words of, fronted from reality.
