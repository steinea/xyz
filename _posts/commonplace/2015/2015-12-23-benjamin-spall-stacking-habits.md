"Kaizen, the Japanese word for “continuous improvement,” is often applied in business situations to improve how a business runs and, therefore, the profitability of the entire operation. Focusing on the belief that good processes bring good results, this same ideal can be applied to you and your habits."

"there are three things that have to happen at the same moment to cause a new behavior. You have to have the motivation to do it, the ability to do it, and a trigger must occur to remind you to do it."

"your trigger can be any existing habit or behavior; so long as you establish exactly what the new habit that follows the trigger will be (more on the science behind that here). We can use this effect to “stack” habits. It sounds silly, but the trigger for my flossing routine was waking up. The trigger for my stretching routine was flossing. And so on."

"Tell yourself: After I [existing habit], I will [new tiny behavior]."
