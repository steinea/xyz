"Both citadelle and cittadella derive from the Latin word civitas, meaning city, coming in turn from civis, the Latin for citizen. The language tells us much. Whether constructed to protect or dominate, the function of a citadel is to help demarcate or determine citizenship, to establish by a display of authority who is and is not entitled to belong."
