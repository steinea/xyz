*for the Landgrave of Homburg*

God is near
<br> Yet hard to seize.
<br> Where there is danger,
<br> The rescue grows as well.
<br> Eagles live in the darkness,
<br> And the sons of the Alps
<br> Go fearlessly over the abyss
<br> Upon bridges simply built.
<br> Therefore, since the peaks
<br> Of Time are heaped all about,
<br> And dear ones live close by,
<br> Worn down on the most separated mountains —
<br> Then give us innocent waters;
<br> Give us wings, and the truest minds
<br> To voyage over and then again to return.

Thus I spoke, when faster
<br> Than I could imagine a spirit
<br> In the twilight
<br> Seduced me out of my own home
<br> To a place I never thought I’d visit.
<br> The shaded forests and longing
<br> Streams of my homeland.
<br> I couldn’t recognize the lands,
<br> but then suddenly
<br> In fresh a glow, mysterious
<br> In the golden haze, quickly emerging
<br> In the steps of the sun,
<br> With the fragrance of a thousand peaks,
<br> Asia rose before me, and dazzled
<br> I searched for something
<br> Familiar, since the broad alleyways
<br> Were unknown to me: where the gold-ornamented
<br> Patoklos comes rushing down from Tmolus,
<br> Where Taurus is to be found, and Messogis,
<br> And the gardens are full of flowers,
<br> Like a quiet fire. Up above
<br> In the light the silver snow
<br> Blooms, and ivy grows from ancient
<br> Times on the inapproachable walls,
<br> Like a witness to immortal life,
<br> While the joyous, the god-built palaces
<br> Are borne by living columns
<br> Of cypress, cedar and laurel.

But around Asia’s gates
<br> Swish pulling here and there
<br> At an uncertain sea level
<br> With enough unshaded straits,
<br> Though the sailor knows these islands.
<br> And when I heard,
<br> that one of these close by
<br> Was Patmos, I wanted very much
<br> To put in there, to enter
<br> The dark grotto. For unlike
<br> Cyprus, rich with springs,
<br> Or any of the others, Patmos

Is housed on earth poorly,
<br> But nevertheless is hospitable
<br> And if a stranger should come to her,
<br> Sent by shipwrecked or longing for
<br> His home or for a departed friend,
<br> She’ll gladly listen, and her
<br> Offspring as well, the voices
<br> In the hot grove, so that where sands blow
<br> and heat cracks the tops of the fields,
<br> They hear him, these voices,
<br> And lovingly sound the man’s grief.
<br> Thus she once looked after
<br> The seer who was loved by god,
<br> Who in his holy youth

Had walked together inseparably
<br> With the Son of the Highest,
<br> Because the Bringer-of-Storms loved
<br> The simplicity of this disciple.
<br> Thus did that attentive man observe
<br> The countenance of the god precisely,
<br> There at the mystery of the grapevine,
<br> Where they sat together at the hour
<br> Of the Last Supper, when the Lord with
<br> His great spirit quietly envisioning His
<br> Own death, and forespoke it and also
<br> His final act of love, for He always
<br> Had words of kindness to speak,
<br> Even then in His prescience,
<br> To soften the violence and wildness of the world.
<br> For all is good. Then He died. Much
<br> Could be said about it. At the end
<br> His friends recognized how filled with joy
<br> He appeared, how victorious.

And yet the men grieved, now that evening
<br> Had come, and were taken by surprise,
<br> Since they were full of great intentions,
<br> And loved living under the sun,
<br> And didn’t want to leave the countenance
<br> Of the Lord, and of their home.
<br> It penetrated them like fire into iron,
<br> And the One they love walked beside them
<br> Like a shadow. Therefore He sent
<br> The Spirit upon them, and the house
<br> Shook and God’s house and weather rolled
<br> Over their heads, filled with anticipation, while
<br> They were gathered with heavy hearts,
<br> Like heroes whose death approached,

Then once more He appeared to them
<br> At his departure. For now
<br> The royal day of the sun
<br> Was extinguished, as he cast
<br> The shining scepter from himself,
<br> With godlike suffering, but knowing
<br> He would come again at the right time.
<br> It would have been wrong
<br> To cut off disloyally His work
<br> The work of humankind, since now it brought Him joy
<br> To live on in loving night, to preserve
<br> Before simple eyes, unrelated
<br> The depths of wisdom. Deep in the
<br> Mountains grew also living images,

Yet it is terrible how God here and there
<br> Scatters the living, and how very far they are flung.
<br> And how fearsome it was to leave
<br> The sight of dear friends and walk off
<br> Alone far over the mountains, where
<br> The Holy Spirit was twice
<br> Recognized, in unity.
<br> It hadn’t been prophesied to them:
<br> Rather it seized them right by the hair
<br> Just at the moment when the God
<br> Who had turned from them, looked back, and they called out to Him
<br> To stop, and they reached their hands to
<br> One another as if bound by a golden cord,
<br> And called it evil —

But when He dies —He about whom beauty hangs
<br> Loved most of all, so that a miracle
<br> Surrounded him, and he was the
<br> Elect of the heavens —
<br> And when those who lived together
<br> Thereafter in His memory, became
<br> Perplexed and no longer understood
<br> One another; and when floods carry off
<br> The sand and willows and temples,
<br> And when the fame of the demi-god
<br> And His disciples is blown away
<br> And even the Highest turns aside his
<br> Countenance, so that nothing
<br> Immortal can be seen either
<br> In heaven or upon the green earth —
<br> What meaning must we take from all of this?

It is the cast of the sower, as he seizes
<br> Wheat with his shovel
<br> Throwing it into the clear air,
<br> Swinging it across the threshing floor.
<br> The chaff falls to his feet, but
<br> The grain emerges in the end.
<br> It’s not bad if some of it gets lost,
<br> Or if the sounds of His living speech
<br> Fade away. For the divine work
<br> resembles our own:
<br> The Highest doesn’t want all to be
<br> Accomplished at once.
<br> As mines yield iron,
<br> And Ætna its glowing haze,
<br> Then I’d have wealth sufficient
<br> To form a picture of Him and see
<br> What he was, the Christ.

But if somebody spurred himself on
<br> Along the road and, speaking sadly,
<br> Fell upon me and surprised me, so that
<br> Like a servant I’d make an image of the God —
<br> Once I saw the lords
<br> Of heaven visibly angered, not
<br> That I wanted to become something different,
<br> But that I wanted to learn something more.
<br> The lords are kind, but while they reign
<br> They hate falsehood most, when humans become
<br> Inhuman. For not they, but undying Fate
<br> It is that rules, and their work
<br> Transforms itself and quickly reaches an end.
<br> When the heavenly triumph proceeds higher.
<br> Then the joyful Son of the Highest
<br> Is called like the sun by the strong,

As a watchword, like the staff of a song
<br> That points downwards,
<br> For nothing is ordinary. It awakens
<br> The dead, those raised incorruptible.
<br> And many are waiting whose eyes are
<br> Still too shy to see the light directly.
<br> They wouldn’t do well in the sharp
<br> Ray: a golden bridle
<br> Holds back their courage.
<br> But when quiet radiance falls
<br> From the Holy Scripture, with
<br> The world forgotten and their eyes
<br> Swollen, then they may enjoy that grace,
<br> And study the quiet image.

And if the heavens love me,
<br> As I now believe,
<br> Then how much more
<br> Do they love you.
<br> For I know one thing:
<br> That the will of the eternal Father
<br> Concerns you greatly.
<br> Under a thundering sky
<br> His sign is silent.
<br> And there is One who stands
<br> Beneath it all his life.
<br> For Christ still lives.
<br> But the heroes, all his sons
<br> Have come, and the Holy Scriptures
<br> Concerning Him and the lightening,
<br> Explain the deeds of the Earth up to this day,
<br> Like a footrace that knows no end.
<br> And He is with us too, for his works and all
<br> Known to Him from the very beginning.

For far too long
<br> The honor of the heavens
<br> Has gone unseen.
<br> They practically have to
<br> Guide our fingers as we write,
<br> And with embarrassment the power
<br> Is ripped from our hearts.
<br> For every heavenly being
<br> Expects a sacrifice,
<br> And when this is neglected,
<br> Nothing good can come of it.
<br> Without awareness we’ve served at the feet of
<br> Our Mother Earth, and the Light
<br> Of the Sun as well, but what our Father
<br> Who reigns over everything wants most
<br> Is that the established Word be
<br> Caringly attended, and that
<br> Which endures be construed well.
<br> German song must accord with this.
