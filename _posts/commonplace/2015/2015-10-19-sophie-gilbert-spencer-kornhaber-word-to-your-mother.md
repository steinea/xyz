"This is the genius and the horror of The Leftovers, the way it indicts all moral systems as false and exploitative while also exonerating them as necessary for sanity and happiness. It isn’t blaming anyone for starting micro-religions; it’s explaining why they spring up at all. Maybe, though, there’s a great unifier coming in the form of whoever was resurrected in Australia, the same place that Kevin’s dad wanted to move to, the same place that the watchtower man in Jarden mailed a letter."
