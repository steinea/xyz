I 

That is no country for old men. The young 
<br>In one another's arms, birds in the trees, 
<br>—Those dying generations—at their song, 
<br>The salmon-falls, the mackerel-crowded seas, 
<br>Fish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer long 
<br>Whatever is begotten, born, and dies. 
<br>Caught in that sensual music all neglect 
<br>Monuments of unageing intellect. 


II 

An aged man is but a paltry thing, 
<br>A tattered coat upon a stick, unless 
<br>Soul clap its hands and sing, and louder sing 
<br>For every tatter in its mortal dress, 
<br>Nor is there singing school but studying 
<br>Monuments of its own magnificence; 
<br>And therefore I have sailed the seas and come 
<br>To the holy city of Byzantium. 


III 

O sages standing in God's holy fire 
<br>As in the gold mosaic of a wall, 
<br>Come from the holy fire, perne in a gyre, 
<br>And be the singing-masters of my soul. 
<br>Consume my heart away; sick with desire 
<br>And fastened to a dying animal 
<br>It knows not what it is; and gather me 
<br>Into the artifice of eternity. 


IV 

Once out of nature I shall never take 
<br>My bodily form from any natural thing, 
<br>But such a form as Grecian goldsmiths make 
<br>Of hammered gold and gold enamelling 
<br>To keep a drowsy Emperor awake; 
<br>Or set upon a golden bough to sing 
<br>To lords and ladies of Byzantium 
<br>Of what is past, or passing, or to come.
