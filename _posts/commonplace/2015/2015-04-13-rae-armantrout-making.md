“What made this happen?”
<br>you ask every time

as if
<br>compulsion itself
<br>were mandatory,

the way light travels
<br>at the speed of light

“because it must”

*

It is in no sense
<br>essential

that this crown of leaves,
<br>sifted by wind

as if turning over
<br>some problem,

is a gray-green
<br>brightening into rust-red

at the tips

or that its equivocations
<br>fill this instant

to the brim.

*

While light
<br>has caught up

to itself
<br>again

and only seems
<br>to be making

time
