"Yet if the concept of 'politics' is to be explanatory it should show how power gets dispersed and rebalanced among contending groups. Politics is how people adjust to one anotherâ€™s needs and potential for violence. In the circumstance where one party has all the power, though, the invocation of politics seems unhelpful. The politics of a slaughterhouse is not really politics, at least not to the pigs; it is just a division of the labor."
