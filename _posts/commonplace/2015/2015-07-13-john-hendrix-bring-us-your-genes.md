"Scientists discovered that most genetic material is passed from each parent to child in a remarkably structured architecture that consists of a predictable number of genes chunked together and kept largely unchanged, in a grouping called a haplotype. These haplotypes were believed to have developed very early in human evolution, which meant there were only a small number of common flavors possibly carried by every single person."
