I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.   
<br>I feel my fate in what I cannot fear.   
<br>I learn by going where I have to go. 

We think by feeling. What is there to know?   
<br>I hear my being dance from ear to ear.   
<br>I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow. 

Of those so close beside me, which are you?   
<br>God bless the Ground!   I shall walk softly there,   
<br>And learn by going where I have to go. 

Light takes the Tree; but who can tell us how?   
<br>The lowly worm climbs up a winding stair;   
<br>I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow. 

Great Nature has another thing to do   
<br>To you and me; so take the lively air,   
<br>And, lovely, learn by going where to go. 

This shaking keeps me steady. I should know.   
<br>What falls away is always. And is near.   
<br>I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.   
<br>I learn by going where I have to go.
