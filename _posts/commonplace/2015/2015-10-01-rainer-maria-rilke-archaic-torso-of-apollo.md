We cannot know his legendary head
<br>with eyes like ripening fruit. And yet his torso
<br>is still suffused with brilliance from inside,
<br>like a lamp, in which his gaze, now turned to low,

gleams in all its power. Otherwise
<br>the curved breast could not dazzle you so, nor could 
<br>a smile run through the placid hips and thighs
<br>to that dark center where procreation flared.

Otherwise this stone would seem defaced
<br>beneath the translucent cascade of the shoulders
<br>and would not glisten like a wild beastâ€™s fur:

would not, from all the borders of itself,
<br>burst like a star: for here there is no place
<br>that does not see you. You must change your life.
