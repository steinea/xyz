One example of *hierophany* is the apparition of angels. 
<br>This is a new word I overheard this morning. It occurs
<br>when the divine realm manifests — or the word intrudes —  
<br>into our quotidian realm. The natural one, an untidy 
<br>fleshliness of the ordinary. Or the sacred and profane
<br>is another way to say this. I asked whether it is a hernia, 
<br>and the answer was no. A herniated condition is viscera 
<br>on viscera — a disc, organs, the skin, or nerves. Besides, 
<br>such a comparison would be profane. A figure of speech 
<br>already exists, I said, in a hieratic silence of cursive 
<br>writing long ago dead. Not long ago, those two phrases 
<br>dwelled in separate worlds. I dare you to use the word 
<br>*hernia* in a poem, said a friend. So I not only used
<br>the word, I invited God into language. Or God existed 
<br>before language, while God is also the word. Remember, 
<br>all theophanies are forms of  hierophany. However,
<br>the converse is not always true — not all hierophanies
<br>are theophanies — or God visible in our world.
