"“An approach of decontextualized individualism is inappropriate for analysis of stripping because, unlike the women who strip, the club owners and entrepreneurs are very organized nationally and internationally,” she writes. “They are not operating simply as individuals.”"

"it’s also not divorced from the dynamics of the larger economy and culture as many discussions of individual empowerment and sexuality suggest."
