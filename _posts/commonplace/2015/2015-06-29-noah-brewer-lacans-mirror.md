"We can see Hegel’s Master-Slave Dialectic at play in the interaction which Lacan conceives of between the child and his mirror image. Here, the child understands the image in the mirror to be Other than himself. It is not actually part of himself, but the child incorporates this “specular I” as Other into himself when he begins to interact with others. Thus Lacan’s concept of “paranoiac alienation” occurs as the true self (the inner, inexpressible, and fragmented self that the child first knew) is subdued, enslaved and repressed by this “specular I” in its first attempts to interact socially."
