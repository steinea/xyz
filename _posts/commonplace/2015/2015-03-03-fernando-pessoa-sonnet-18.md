XVIII.Â 

Indefinite space, which, by co-substance night,
<br>In one black mystery two void mysteries blends;
<br>The stray stars, whose innumerable light
<br>Repeats one mystery till conjecture ends;
<br>The stream of time, known by birth-bursting bubbles;
<br>The gulf of silence, empty even of nought;
<br>Thought's high-walled maze, which the outed owner troubles
<br>Because the string's lost and the plan forgot:
<br>When I think on this and that here I stand,
<br>The thinker of these thoughts, emptily wise,
<br>Holding up to my thinking my thing-hand
<br>And looking at it with thought-alien eyes,
<br>The prayer of my wonder looketh past
<br>The universal darkness lone and vast.
