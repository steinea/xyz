“This is the very mode that Jung suggested for grasping dreams - not as a sequence in time, but as revolving around a nodal complex. If dreams, then why not the dreamers. We too are not only a sequence in time, a process of individuation. We are also each an image of individuality. We each turn in a vortex, and each movement in that vortex, that complex, opens another perceptive insight, reveals another face of our image.”
