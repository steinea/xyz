I wish I would
<br>like a ship
<br>that all night carries
<br>its beloved captain
<br>sleeping through
<br>no weather
<br>slip past dawn
<br>and wake with nothing
<br>but strange things
<br>that did not happen
<br>to report
<br>but I get up
<br>in the dark
<br>and parachute
<br>quietly down
<br>to the kitchen
<br>to begin
<br>the purely mental
<br>ritual plugging
<br>in of the useless
<br>worry machine
<br>above me
<br>she sleeps
<br>like the innocent
<br>still dreaming older
<br>sister to all
<br>gentle things
<br>the white screen
<br>impassively asks
<br>me to say what
<br>does not matter
<br>does so I shut
<br>it down and think
<br>about the lake
<br>near where I live
<br>itâ€™s a lagoon
<br>getting lighter
<br>like an old blue
<br>just switched on
<br>television
<br>maybe a Zenith
<br>it has two arms
<br>they stretch
<br>without feeling
<br>east to embrace
<br>an empty park
<br>a little light
<br>then everything
<br>has a shadow
<br>I almost hear
<br>a silent bell
<br>low voices
<br>I brought us
<br>to this old city
<br>the port connects
<br>to the world
<br>where everyone
<br>pretends to know
<br>they live
<br>on an island
<br>waiting for
<br>the giant wave
<br>in some form
<br>maybe radiation
<br>in the yard
<br>the wind blows
<br>the whole black
<br>sky looks down
<br>for an instant
<br>through my sleepy
<br>isolate frame
<br>a complex child
<br>hologram flickers
<br>angrily holding
<br>a green plastic shovel
<br>then disappears
<br>leaving an empty
<br>column waiting
<br>Bill who I knew
<br>was so angry
<br>is dead
<br>whatever he was
<br>going through
<br>I kept away
<br>I never did
<br>anything
<br>I love his poem
<br>he was really good
<br>I keep forgetting
<br>his last name
<br>I always leave
<br>his handmade book
<br>on my desk
<br>not to remember
<br>but because for hours
<br>after everything
<br>everyone says
<br>sounds like a language
<br>I never knew
<br>but now speak
<br>spirit I know
<br>you would have hated
<br>how I think
<br>you would have liked
<br>this music
<br>in another room
<br>pushing the alien
<br>voice into
<br>the millennium
<br>the one you left
<br>so early
<br>spirit
<br>you were right
<br>all noble
<br>things are gone
<br>except to struggle
<br>and be loved
