"Fundamentalism is a protest against that rationalistic interpretation of Christianity which seeks to discredit supernaturalism"

"After being adopted by Laws, however, the idea of fundamentalism spread beyond core doctrinal beliefs and became gradually identified with a set of attitudes about proper Christian behavior and thoughtâ€”against drinking and dancing, against the teaching of evolution in schools. And so the term began to acquire its modern connotations of rigid orthodoxy."
