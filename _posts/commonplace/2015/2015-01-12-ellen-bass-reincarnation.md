Who would believe in reincarnation
<br>if she thought she would return as
<br>an oyster? Eagles and wolves
<br>are popular. Even domesticated cats
<br>have their appeal. It’s not terribly distressing
<br>to imagine being Missy, nibbling
<br>kibble and lounging on the windowsill.
<br>But I doubt the toothsome oyster has ever
<br>been the totem of any shaman fanning the Mother
<br>peace Tarotor smudging with sage.
<br>Yet perhaps we could do worse
<br>than aspire to be a plump bivalve. Humbly,
<br>the oyster persists in filtering
<br>seawater and fashioning the daily
<br>irritations into lustre.
<br>Dash a dot of Tabasco, pair it
<br>with a dry Martini, not only
<br>will this tender button inspire
<br>an erotic fire in tuxedoed men
<br>and women whose shoulders gleam
<br>in candlelight, this hermit praying
<br>in its rocky cave, this anchorite of iron,
<br>calcium, and protein, is practically a molluskan saint. 
<br>Revered and sacrificed,
<br>body and salty liquor of the soul,
<br>the oyster is devoured, surrendering
<br>all—again and again—for love.
