"EUROPE is falling apart, or that is to say a certain kind of Europe is falling apart."

"Europe has tried to divorce itself from the previous century’s wars and genocides, as if the continent was born anew in the 1989 revolutions and washed clean in Maastricht. It has been a vast neo-liberal project, leveling and unifying nationalities, classes, and markets in a sweep that is as much mythological as technical. It is a project of reinvention—so grand it is almost literary—that attempts to create a new and permanent present while obscuring the past."
