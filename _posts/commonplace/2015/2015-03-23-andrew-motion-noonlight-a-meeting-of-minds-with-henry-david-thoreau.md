I remind myself when I reach the pond at sunset 
<br> how far water reveals itself by night, 
<br> as the moon shimmering across the surface, 
<br> tightens into a pyramid of light 
<br> that points to me, 
<br> that points me out indeed 
<br> and, in the same gesture, 
<br> also burns the crests of small waves 
<br> with flames I thought at first were fireflies. 

We do not habitually live our lives in full; 
<br> we do not fill ourselves sufficiently with blood. 

Even so, as they creep close and closer still to me
<br> I see those flames increase, 
<br> so many broken fragments of the moon 
<br> they seem more intense than the moon itself, 
<br> until their brightness makes me turn away, 
<br> and wish for company to 
<br> share my task of looking, 
<br> and the light complete.
