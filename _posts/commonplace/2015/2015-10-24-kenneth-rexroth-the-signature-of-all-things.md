My head and shoulders, and my book
<br>In the cool shade, and my body
<br>Stretched bathing in the sun, I lie
<br>Reading beside the waterfall —
<br>Boehme’s “Signature of all Things.”
<br>Through the deep July day the leaves
<br>Of the laurel, all the colors
<br>Of gold, spin down through the moving
<br>Deep laurel shade all day. They float
<br>On the mirrored sky and forest
<br>For a while, and then, still slowly
<br>Spinning, sink through the crystal deep
<br>Of the pool to its leaf gold floor.
<br>The saint saw the world as streaming
<br>In the electrolysis of love.
<br>I put him by and gaze through shade
<br>Folded into shade of slender
<br>Laurel trunks and leaves filled with sun.
<br>The wren broods in her moss domed nest.
<br>A newt struggles with a white moth
<br>Drowning in the pool. The hawks scream,
<br>Playing together on the ceiling
<br>Of heaven. The long hours go by.
<br>I think of those who have loved me,
<br>Of all the mountains I have climbed,
<br>Of all the seas I have swum in.
<br>The evil of the world sinks.
<br>My own sin and trouble fall away
<br>Like Christian’s bundle, and I watch
<br>My forty summers fall like falling
<br>Leaves and falling water held
<br>Eternally in summer air.

Deer are stamping in the glades,
<br>Under the full July moon.
<br>There is a smell of dry grass
<br>In the air, and more faintly,
<br>The scent of a far off skunk.
<br>As I stand at the wood’s edge,
<br>Watching the darkness, listening
<br>To the stillness, a small owl
<br>Comes to the branch above me,
<br>On wings more still than my breath.
<br>When I turn my light on him,
<br>His eyes glow like drops of iron,
<br>And he perks his head at me,
<br>Like a curious kitten.
<br>The meadow is bright as snow.
<br>My dog prowls the grass, a dark
<br>Blur in the blur of brightness.
<br>I walk to the oak grove where
<br>The Indian village was once.
<br>There, in blotched and cobwebbed light
<br>And dark, dim in the blue haze,
<br>Are twenty Holstein heifers,
<br>Black and white, all lying down,
<br>Quietly together, under
<br>The huge trees rooted in the graves.

When I dragged the rotten log
<br>From the bottom of the pool,
<br>It seemed heavy as stone.
<br>I let it lie in the sun
<br>For a month; and then chopped it
<br>Into sections, and split them
<br>For kindling, and spread them out
<br>To dry some more. Late that night,
<br>After reading for hours,
<br>While moths rattled at the lamp —
<br>The saints and the philosophers
<br>On the destiny of man —
<br>I went out on my cabin porch,
<br>And looked up through the black forest
<br>At the swaying islands of stars.
<br>Suddenly I saw at my feet,
<br>Spread on the floor of night, ingots
<br>Of quivering phosphorescence,
<br>And all about were scattered chips
<br>Of pale cold light that was alive.
