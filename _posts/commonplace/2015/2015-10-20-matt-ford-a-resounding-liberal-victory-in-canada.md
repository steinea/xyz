"At a state dinner hosted by Pierre Trudeau in April 1972, U.S. President Richard Nixon raised a glass to the Canadian prime minister’s then-four-month-old son. “Tonight we’ll dispense with the formalities,” Nixon told the assembled guests, according to the CBC. “I’d like to toast the future prime minister of Canada: to Justin Pierre Trudeau.”"

"I think the cabinet, caucus, civil servants, and outside experts will play a bigger role in decision-making than in most Canadian governments over the past half century—at least for a while."
