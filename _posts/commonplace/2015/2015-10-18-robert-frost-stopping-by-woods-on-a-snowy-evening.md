Whose woods these are I think I know.   
<br>His house is in the village though;   
<br>He will not see me stopping here   
<br>To watch his woods fill up with snow.   

My little horse must think it queer   
<br>To stop without a farmhouse near   
<br>Between the woods and frozen lake   
<br>The darkest evening of the year.   

He gives his harness bells a shake   
<br>To ask if there is some mistake.   
<br>The only other sound’s the sweep   
<br>Of easy wind and downy flake.   

The woods are lovely, dark and deep,   
<br>But I have promises to keep,   
<br>And miles to go before I sleep,   
<br>And miles to go before I sleep.
