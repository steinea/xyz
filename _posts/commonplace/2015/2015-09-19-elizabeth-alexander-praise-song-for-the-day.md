*A Poem for Barack Obama’s Presidential Inauguration*

Each day we go about our business, 
<br>walking past each other, catching each other’s 
<br>eyes or not, about to speak or speaking. 

All about us is noise. All about us is 
<br>noise and bramble, thorn and din, each 
<br>one of our ancestors on our tongues. 

Someone is stitching up a hem, darning 
<br>a hole in a uniform, patching a tire, 
<br>repairing the things in need of repair. 

Someone is trying to make music somewhere, 
<br>with a pair of wooden spoons on an oil drum, 
<br>with cello, boom box, harmonica, voice. 

A woman and her son wait for the bus. 
<br>A farmer considers the changing sky. 
<br>A teacher says, Take out your pencils. Begin.

We encounter each other in words, words 
<br>spiny or smooth, whispered or declaimed, 
<br>words to consider, reconsider. 

We cross dirt roads and highways that mark 
<br>the will of some one and then others, who said 
<br>I need to see what’s on the other side. 

I know there’s something better down the road. 
<br>We need to find a place where we are safe. 
<br>We walk into that which we cannot yet see. 

Say it plain: that many have died for this day. 
<br>Sing the names of the dead who brought us here, 
<br>who laid the train tracks, raised the bridges, 

picked the cotton and the lettuce, built 
<br>brick by brick the glittering edifices 
<br>they would then keep clean and work inside of. 

Praise song for struggle, praise song for the day. 
<br>Praise song for every hand-lettered sign, 
<br>the figuring-it-out at kitchen tables. 

Some live by love thy neighbor as thyself, 
<br>others by first do no harm or take no more 
<br>than you need. What if the mightiest word is love? 

Love beyond marital, filial, national, 
<br>love that casts a widening pool of light, 
<br>love with no need to pre-empt grievance. 

In today’s sharp sparkle, this winter air, 
<br>any thing can be made, any sentence begun. 
<br>On the brink, on the brim, on the cusp, 

praise song for walking forward in that light.
