"But going by the first two hours of Fear, Kirkman and his hand-selected showrunner, Dave Erickson (Sons of Anarchy), have learned from previous mistakes. Fear has more than adrenaline on its side. It has a pulse."

"One of the sharpest choices made in Fear the Walking Dead is the way it doesnâ€™t rush past the frustrating banalities of existence en route to the apocalypse. Perspective matters: We need to appreciate the leaky faucet before we can attend to the gushing artery."

"Fear does a nice job of undermining the subconscious faith in institutions that props up comfortable lives and keeps us from going crazy or at least going H.A.M."

"Fear provides a disturbingly probable ticktock for the breakdown of modern society. Every time the sun sets or a cell phone battery dies, a crucial bit of hope goes with it. The zombies, when they appear, are friends and family, not intestine-dragging randos. Eventually, everyone is touched. Bit by bit, everything fails. The Walking Dead is a show about surviving. Fear, by contrast, is about losing."
