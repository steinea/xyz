He seems an equal of the gods,
<br>That man who sits across from you
<br>And your sweet speaking, being near,
<br>Can overhear
<br>And that seductive laugh, which sets
<br>the heart to flutter in my chest
<br>For when I glance your way, my words
<br>Dissolve unheard.
<br>Silence breaks my tongue and subtle
<br>fire streams beneath my skin,
<br>I can't see with my eyes, or hear
<br>through buzzing ears.
<br>Sweat runs down, a shiver shakes
<br>Me deep -- I feel as pale as grass:
<br>As close to death as that, and green,
<br>Is how I seem.
