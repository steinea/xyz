“It is impos­si­ble at the present time to write his­tory with­out using a whole range of con­cepts directly or indi­rectly linked to Marx’s thought and sit­u­at­ing one­self within a hori­zon of thought which has been defined and described by Marx. One might even won­der what dif­fer­ence there could ulti­mately be between being a his­to­rian and being a Marx­ist.”

“In the con­clud­ing sec­tion to The Will to Knowl­edge, Fou­cault explains what led him to con­sider power, as it exists today, not from a neg­a­tive per­spec­tive – as a con­straint that is ini­tially juridi­cal in form – but from a pos­i­tive one, inas­much as power relies on mech­a­nisms that mate­ri­ally orga­nize and even help to “pro­duce” human life, instead of impos­ing bound­aries on it.”

“This idea is at the very core of his con­cep­tion of “biopower.””

“cault explains in this pas­sage the need to rethink power by free­ing it from the grip of pol­i­tics, so as to bring it closer to the con­crete level of the econ­omy; an econ­omy that is pri­mar­ily con­cerned with the “man­age­ment” of life, bod­ies and their “pow­ers” – a term that per­sis­tently recurs here – even before hav­ing as its focus the value of traded goods within an econ­omy of things.”

“ther­more, for Fou­cault, it is impor­tant to restore a his­tor­i­cal dimen­sion to this new under­stand­ing of power, which he does by relat­ing it to the devel­op­ment of cap­i­tal­ism and the speci­fic social rela­tions of pro­duc­tion set in place in the con­text of the Indus­trial Rev­o­lu­tion.”

“cault appears here to almost flirt with Marx’s analy­ses in Cap­i­tal, which he rec­on­ciles with his attempt to view power from a pos­i­tive and “pro­duc­tive” per­spec­tive.”

“Five years later, com­ing back to this point in a lec­ture given in Bahia in 1976, pub­lished under the evoca­tive title “The Mesh of Power,” Fou­cault explic­itly con­firms this con­ver­gence.”

“Fou­cault means that Ben­tham and Marx are basi­cally talk­ing about the same thing, even if they do so in dif­fer­ent ways: the emer­gence of a new con­fig­u­ra­tion of power, coin­cid­ing with the rise of cap­i­tal­ism and the bour­geoisie, did not solely con­sist of an insti­tu­tional change or a seizure of polit­i­cal power, since it fun­da­men­tally depended upon an orig­i­nal har­ness­ing of the forces of life itself, pro­vid­ing the econ­omy with its speci­fic object ‒ an econ­omy whose trans­for­ma­tions have dri­ven social change.”

“This per­spec­tive, it could be argued, moves toward the the­sis of the deter­mi­na­tion by the econ­omy in the last instance, on con­di­tion that the con­cept is extended to even­tu­ally sub­sume the man­age­ment or the “pro­duc­tion” (to fol­low Foucault’s ambigu­ous term) of life in all of its forms.”

“In the rest of the lec­ture, Fou­cault enu­mer­ates the four dimen­sions that char­ac­ter­ize this his­tor­i­cal and social shift in power, and insis­tently refers to Marx for each one:”

“the dis­per­sion of power into a mul­ti­plic­ity of het­ero­ge­neous pow­ers;”

“its detach­ment from the state-form;”

“its pos­i­tive, rather than pro­hib­i­tive or repres­sive, ori­en­ta­tion;”

“and finally, its pro­gres­sive tech­ni­ciza­tion that devel­oped unplanned through trial and error, and thus was not sub­or­di­nated to any devised or pre­con­ceived ends.”

“When Fou­cault cites the “sec­ond vol­ume of Cap­i­tal,” he clearly has in mind the sec­ond vol­ume of the French edi­tion of Marx’s work, pub­lished by Édi­tions Sociales, which com­prises Parts 4, 5, and 6 of Vol­ume I, the only vol­ume to appear in Marx’s life­time, the final edit­ing of Vol­umes II and III being posthu­mously com­pleted by Engels.”

“Althusser, in a pref­ace writ­ten for the 1969 pub­li­ca­tion of Vol­ume I of Cap­i­tal in Flammarion’s GF book series, had rec­om­mended read­ing it by start­ing directly with the sec­ond half, that is, by skip­ping the first part, as its inter­pre­ta­tion poses the most prob­lems, prob­lems only resolv­able when one gets to the end of the work and can grasp the argu­men­ta­tion as a whole. Fou­cault seems to go even fur­ther, advis­ing that Marx’s book be approached through the fourth part, which deals with “The Pro­duc­tion of Rel­a­tive Sur­plus-Value (Mehrw­ert).””

“Indeed, in this pas­sage he sees, appear­ing for the first time, the ele­ments enabling the def­i­n­i­tion of the new con­fig­u­ra­tion of power, her­alded from the end of the 18th cen­tury by the­o­rists such as Ben­tham: namely, “bour­geois power” and its mech­a­nisms, i.e., the speci­fic pro­ce­dures per­tain­ing to a tech­nol­ogy of power, to whose analy­sis Marx made the great­est con­tri­bu­tion.”

“By focus­ing his atten­tion on this part of Cap­i­tal, Fou­cault thereby finds a way of dis­tanc­ing him­self from the polem­i­cal pre­sen­ta­tion pro­vided in The Order Of Things – not of Marx’s thought stricto sensu, as found in his own texts, but what arose from it in the form of “ortho­dox” Marx­ism, in which Fou­cault had detected an avatar or epiphe­nom­e­non of polit­i­cal econ­omy in its Ricar­dian form, full stop.”

“From this point of view, it is as if Fou­cault pro­posed to add a new chap­ter to the project Althusser him­self ini­ti­ated with the pub­li­ca­tion of Read­ing Cap­i­tal, which had already begun to chal­lenge tra­di­tional, ortho­dox Marx­ism.”

“how is it pos­si­ble to draw the ele­ments of a the­ory of power from the expla­na­tion of the process of the pro­duc­tion of rel­a­tive sur­plus value, with­out falling into over­in­ter­pre­ta­tion, since the prob­lem of power, if not com­pletely extra­ne­ous to this expla­na­tion, is only posed at its mar­gins?”

“Let us say straight away that this ques­tion, which involves the par­tic­u­lar rela­tion that power main­tains with the econ­omy of cap­i­tal­ism, and which leads us to bracket the rela­tions that power might oth­er­wise have with polit­i­cal and state forms, also leads us to take into account and re-estab­lish the pri­mary impor­tance of the notion Marx him­self saw as his prin­ci­pal the­o­ret­i­cal inno­va­tion, because it enabled him to rad­i­cally break with Ricar­dian eco­nom­ics: the con­cept of “labor-power,” whose word­ing con­tains pre­cisely a ref­er­ence to “power,” a ref­er­ence Fou­cault attaches such impor­tance to in his own con­cep­tion of the new econ­omy of power.”

“This econ­omy, it can be said, is not an econ­omy of things or goods but an econ­omy of “forces,” and as such, inex­tri­ca­bly an econ­omy of per­sons; an econ­omy which in real­ity is closely inte­grated with pro­ce­dures for the sub­jec­tion of per­sons and, more pre­cisely, bod­ies.”

“To put it in Foucault’s terms, we must ask our­selves how cap­i­tal­ism, by uti­liz­ing the exploita­tion of labor-power, devel­oped “meth­ods of power capa­ble of optimiz­ing forces, apti­tudes, and life in gen­eral with­out at the same time mak­ing them more dif­fi­cult to gov­ern.””

“It should be noted that the aim of such an inquiry is not to demon­strate that Foucault’s ideas are already black and white in Marx’s text, which would amount to invent­ing the fic­tion of a “Marx­ist” or “Marx­isant” Fou­cault, as such an heir to Marx, but to enrich our poten­tial under­stand­ing of this text, by clar­i­fy­ing it in light of the hypothe­ses Fou­cault advances and thus tra­vers­ing the path that leads from Fou­cault back to Marx in the hope of reveal­ing new aspects of the latter’s thought and – this is the point that pri­mar­ily con­cerns us – refram­ing the ques­tion of power in par­tic­u­lar by shift­ing it from the level of pol­i­tics to that of the econ­omy.”

“This text was orig­i­nally writ­ten as a con­tri­bu­tion to the col­lec­tive research project headed by Macherey, “Savoirs, Tex­tes, Lan­gage,” and first appeared on the group’s web­site, “La philoso­phie au sens large.” It sub­se­quently appeared in a slightly mod­i­fied form in Macherey’s 2014 col­lec­tion of essays, Le Sujet des normes. The present trans­la­tion is based on the ini­tial ver­sion. We thank the pub­lisher of Le sujet des normes, Édi­tions Ams­ter­dam, for allow­ing the release of the trans­la­tion.”
