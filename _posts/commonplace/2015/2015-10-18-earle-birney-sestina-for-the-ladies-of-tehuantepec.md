"Teh. has six claims to fame:      its numerous hotsprings
<br>(radioactive, therapeutic); moderate earthquakes
<br>(none in several years) ; herbivorous iguanas
<br>(eaten stewed); Dictator Porfirio Diaz
<br>(d. 1911); its hundred-mile-wide isthmus;
<br>and the commanding beauty of its Indian women."

Stately still and tall as gilliflowers the women
<br>though they no longer glide unwary past the hotsprings
<br>naked as sunlight to each slender softer isthmus
<br>now that ogling busloads (Greyhound) make their earth quake
<br>And still skirt-bright before the flaking palace of old Diaz
<br>(hotel) they gravely offer up their cold iguanas

Their furtive men (unfamed)      who snare iguanas
<br>sliding on tree-limbs olive-smooth as are their women's
<br>have fallen out of peonage to landlord Diaz
<br>into an air more active than their tepid hotsprings
<br>more prompt with tremors than the obsolete earthquakes
<br>rumbling through their intercontinental isthmus

From the stone music of their past the only isthmus
<br>from astronomic shrines fantastic as iguanas
<br>to this unlikely world (3 bil.) that waits its earthquake
<br>is their long matriarchal ritual of women
<br>whose eyes from fires more stubborn than under hotsprings
<br>flash out a thousand Mayan years before a Diaz

Goldnecklaced      turbaned      swaying in the square of Diaz
<br>volute and secret as the orchids in their isthmus
<br>braids black and luminous as obsidian by hotsprings
<br>beneath their crowns of fruit      and crested live iguanas
<br>rhythmic and Zapotecan-proud the classic women
<br>dance (v. marimbas) their ancient therapy for earthquakes

0 dance      and hurl flamboya      till the cobbled earth quakes
<br>let your strong teeth shine out in the plaza lost to Diaz
<br>toss your soaring sunflower plumes      sunflowering women!
<br>Hold for all men yet your supple blossoming isthmus
<br>lest we be noosed      consumed with all iguanas
<br>and leave the radiant leaping of the lonely hotsprings

Beneath all hotsprings lie the triggered earthquakes
<br>Within this gray iguana coils another Diaz
<br>Is there a green isthmus walking yet in women?


Salina Cruz, México 1956
