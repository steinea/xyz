"Noir emerged from the aftermath of World War II into a society that no longer had faith in the inherent goodness of its fellow humans. It worked to expose the sordid underbelly of the modern social system and fit into a growing culture of existentialism that questioned our place in the universe. Television may exhibit the outer trappings of classic noir, borrowing the look, dialogue, or character archetypes. But television’s goals are less esoteric and, historically, the medium has worked to build rather than undermine a sense of confidence in mainstream culture. A crime drama’s characters may be flawed and the justice system portrayed therein is far from perfect, but the majority of television shows offer closure and resolution. Even the grittiest, most violent antihero serves the cause of justice, protecting those who are weaker than he is. Even should a rapist go free, the system gave the victim a voice and a chance to fight back that she might not have had otherwise. Crimes may go unpunished, but they rarely go unsolved."
