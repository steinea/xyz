"Developed by Murray Bookchin, Social Ecology emphasizes the importance of understanding how social and ecological issues arise from domination and how they are perpetuated through the hierarchical, centralized organization of society"

"It suggests that decentralized, non-hierarchical forms of social organization, which take into account ecological principles, are the path toward a future that blurs the dichotomy between “humanity and nature” and addresses the harmful social and environmental divisions that this separation has facilitated"

"The particular approach suggested here is based on an ethos of epistemological autonomy that would encourage a decentralized and fluid perspective on knowledge"

"Applying this epistemic fluidity to the philosophy of Social Ecology helps to reassert its rootedness in the tradition of ecological anarchism from which it emerged"

"Many of its foundational ideas are based on the work of historic anarchists such as Élisée Reclus and Peter Kropotkin. By viewing Social Ecology as separate from Murray Bookchin, and instead through the vision of the theoretical lineage from which it is contextually situated, we can create space for contributions from a more diverse group of contemporary thinkers and further develop the distinctly eco-anarchist philosophy of Social Ecology"

"This approach would inform more intersectional and holistic approaches to addressing social and ecological issues by considering the multiple and intersecting systems of power and oppression that shape our relationships with the natural world"

"By taking a radically intersectional and holistic approach, a Poststructural Social Ecology can more effectively address the specific root causes of social and ecological problems – as opposed to remaining theoretically dependent on a sometimes amorphous macroscopic conception of hierarchy – to work towards creating lasting and transformative change"

"This new iteration of Social Ecology would also recognize the importance of diverse and decentralized forms of social organization"

"Rather than advocating for a specific programmatic model, such as Bookchin’s Libertarian Municipalism, it would embrace the complexity and multiplicity of approaches to creating a more just and equitable society"

"This could involve experimenting with a variety of forms of social organization and tactics, and being open to learning from diverse perspectives and experiences"

"Rather than strict adherence to predetermined models or solutions it would necessarily encourage the exploration of new and innovative approaches to creating change"

"A poststructural approach, on the other hand, would reject the idea of a singular, linear process of change and instead emphasize the complexity and multiplicity of social and ecological relationships"
