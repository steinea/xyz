"Any point in a composition can be the center of symmetry, or the center of rotation. Any straight line in a composition can be an axis of symmetry, or an axis of rotation"

"Any plane in a composition can be a plane of symmetry"

"A combination of points, straight and curved lines, volumes and haziness is always a masterpiece, because it is always universal"

"The difference between architecture, sculpture, painting and drawing is that architecture builds human dwellings, while the other art forms are decoration of these dwellings, making the dwellings more universal; i.e. making them masterpieces composed of masterpieces. Hence, the last consideration: if we can turn a work of painting, sculpture or drawing into a human dwelling, and this—

can be achieved by creating these works at an enlarged scale – we turn these works of sculpture, painting and drawing into works of architecture"

"Nature and art know nothing isolated, separate, nor independent. Every object and every idea appears to us as a multitude of gradually changing variables"

"The infinite perspectives of rows of variations, intersected by the thinnest plane of the present, create a separate row of points, carved out of a bundle of lines and threads, which we perceive as the present"

"But there are neighbors"

"a masterpiece of universal design does not appear all at once, like a jack-in-the-box – ready and complete in all respects. On the contrary, a masterpiece of composition in its final, universal form is born over time."
