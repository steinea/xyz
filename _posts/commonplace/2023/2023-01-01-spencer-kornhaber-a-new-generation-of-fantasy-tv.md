"Shortly after *Dragon*’s August premiere, Amazon launched *The Rings of Power*, a prequel to J. R. R. Tolkien’s *The* *Lord of the Rings* tale, and the costliest television series of all time. Throughout the year, too, Disney deployed multiple *Star Wars* shows—the slickest and best among them being the spy thriller *Andor*. Viewers were generally spoiled for explosive, CGI-laden action mixed with slow-burn, episodic storytelling. But the difference between spectacle and spark, self-seriousness and serious entertainment, has never been more glaring"

"Our present era of franchise-driven TV requires the industrialization of spectacle, but all the money in the galaxy can’t ensure crackling dialogue and convincing acting"
