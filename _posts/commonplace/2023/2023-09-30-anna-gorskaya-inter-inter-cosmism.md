"The full-scale invasion of Ukraine unleashed by the Putin regime in 2022 forced everyone connected with the Russian intellectual and artistic context to question the possibility of continuing their own occupations without reflecting on its foundations"

"For sure, researchers of Russian cosmism in its broad sense—from Nikolai Fedorov’s active Christianity to Konstantin Tsiolkovsky’s atomic monism and Valerian Muravyev’s mastering of time—face a similar predicament"

"The answer to this challenge, as it emerges from the overall agenda and specific texts of *Cosmic Bulletin 2022*, can be characterized as persistent doubt about the cosmist program, which Boris Groys defines as a “cosmic biopolitics,” a regime in which “the state can no longer permit itself to allow individuals to die privately or the dead to rest peacefully in their graves. Death’s limits must be overcome by the state. Biopower must become total.”"

"we find it impossible not to ask certain questions. Why should we master time? Why should reason, however paradoxical, necessarily conquer this “blind force”?"

"*Cosmic Bulletin 2022* looks for guidance from a variety of intellectual traditions that demand we replace the binaries dictated by “political insidiousness” with the supremely complex, multiple, infinitely transformable formulas of a free material dynamics"

"Along with Deleuze and Guattari’s rhizome and its “lines of flight,” as traced in feminist epistemology, the new anthropology, neo-materialism, and speculative realism, we follow here also cosmist philosophy itself in its anarcho-biocosmist recension"

"Russian cosmism has traditionally denied its national origins, declaring itself an international project. However, this universalism has often been dictated by a domineering, paternalistic stance"
