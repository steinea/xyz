Tiqqun: "The deconstructionist, incapable of having an effect on even the smallest detail of his world, being literally almost no longer in the world and having made absence his permanent mode of being, tries to  embrace his Bloomhood with bravado. He shuts himself up in that narrow, closed circle of realities that still affect him at all--books, texts, films, and music--because these things are as insubstantial as he is. He can no longer see anything in what he reads that might relate to life, and instead sees what he lives as a tissue of references to what he has already read."

The deconstructionist, yes, but also so many other academics...
