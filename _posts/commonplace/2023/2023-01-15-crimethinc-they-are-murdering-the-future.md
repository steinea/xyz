"As climate change approaches the point of no return, rememberâ€”after September 11, 2001, the FBI declared that environmental activists were enemy #1.

As temperatures soar, remember how politicians passed legislation to protect fossil fuel profiteers.

As hurricanes pummel the coast, remember how the cops swabbed pepper spray into protesters' eyes.

As flash floods destroy towns, remember all the people they brutalized at Standing Rock.

As forests go up in smoke, remember how riot police charged the crowds so they could expand the open-pit mine at #Lutzerath.

As the polar ice caps melt, remember how prosecutors charged young people with terrorism for trying to protect the environment that we all depend on.

Remember who is responsible.

If not for their violence, we could have dealt with the ones who are driving climate change long ago.

In return for a few dollars, they are forcing the end of the world on us."
