"What is important here is that thought transpires in and through our bodies. Where there is no body, there is no thought"

"In *The Meaning of Thought*, Markus Gabriel claims that thought is an integral part of personhood and another fundamental sense that we humans possess. 'The key thesis of the book,” he writes, “says that our thought is a sense, just like sight, taste, hearing, feeling or touch. Through thinking, we touch a reality accessible only to thought, just as colours are usually accessible only to sight and sounds to hearing.'"

"*The Meaning of Thought*’s claim that thought is a sense follows up on Gabriel’s previous book, *I Am Not a Brain*, where he argued against current dogmas that thinking can be reduced to neurology. In both books, Gabriel engages with a number of philosophers of mind, neurological reductionists, and AI apologists as he sets out to dismantle notions that our new artificial intelligences, which seem so marvelous in their abilities, actually possess intelligence. Whatever intelligence they display, Gabriel claims, derives from the researchers and programmers who create them"
