"By now, many of you have seen the footage of the monk (or mud wizard) facing off with hapless riot police during the defense of #Lutzerath this past weekend."

"According to le Monde, the police ambushed the monk among a group of other defenders. The monk threw three buckets of water at the police, proclaiming "I baptize you in the name of the ZAD!" In the ensuing chaos, he made off with one of their batons."

"Victory to the mud wizards! Defend the earth!"
