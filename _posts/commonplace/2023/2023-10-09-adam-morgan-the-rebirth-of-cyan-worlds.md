"In the mid-’90s, more than 6 million cardboard boxes and jewel cases of *[Myst](https://www.inverse.com/gaming/best-puzzle-games-on-game-pass-2021-myst)* flew off shelves faster than retailers could restock them, and a tiny indie studio called Cyan, Inc. (now Cyan Worlds) became the first garage band to go multiplatinum in the punk-rock days of CD-ROM"

"A long-awaited sequel, 1997’s *Riven,* was heralded as a visual and narrative masterpiece in its own right. But in the 2000s, Cyan made a bold investment in the future of gaming that backfired, forcing the CEO to lay off all but two of its 40-person staff"

"After nearly a decade with no major releases, a 2013 Kickstarter campaign revived the studio. Now, it’s making award-winning games again in an industry dominated by corporate behemoths and buyouts"

"**Robyn Miller:** I was really into Jules Verne at the time, and I was reading *The Mysterious Island*, so there are a lot of similar themes. The name *Myst* definitely came from that book"

"**Robyn Miller:** We went back and forth and argued about the name. I was on the side that said, “We're going to name this thing *Riven,* and we’re not even going to put *Myst* on the box!” And Rand was on the side that said, “No, this is *Myst II,* we need to put *Myst* on the box.” In hindsight, I think Rand was right. A lot of people went into stores who wanted to buy the next *Myst,* and they never saw it"

"*After licensing the rights for* Myst III *and* Myst IV *to another studio, Cyan began staffing up for* Uru, *an ambitious online RPG with real-time 3D environments set in the underground city of D’ni and other worlds. But the fate of* Uru *— and of Cyan itself — may have been sealed the day they signed a deal with Ubisoft*"

"**Eric A. Anderson:** Double Fine was making big news for raising millions of dollars on a Kickstarter for *Broken Age,* and Ryan Warzecha was like, “If Double Fine can do it, Cyan should be able to.”"
