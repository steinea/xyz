"Task-oriented user stories lead to bad product decisions because they mix up value with cost. But they are easy to turn into inverted user stories — a tool for thinking bigger"

"Since their invention in 1997, user stories have become ubiquitous"

"Scrum manuals and Agile coaches have drilled the format into product owners for decades, to the point that “user story” and “ticket” have become nearly synonymous"

"The user story went from

> As [user] I want [to reach a goal] so that I can [obtain a benefit]

to

> As [user] I want [to do a task] so that I can [use the tool]"

"Sometimes, even the “so that” is missing entirely: As a user, I want to log in."

"The truth is: I don’t want to use a product at all."

"The ideal user experience is that I reach my goal without doing any work"

"The original user story format reminded us of this by staying focused purely on the goal"

"Task-oriented user stories replaced the goal with the work: all downside without any of the benefits"
