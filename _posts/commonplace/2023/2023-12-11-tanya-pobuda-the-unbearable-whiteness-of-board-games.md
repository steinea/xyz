"My PhD research study of the top 400 *BoardGameGeek* games found that that 92.6% of the labour of game design was that of white-identified, male-identified creators"

"Whenever a representative sample doesn’t map AT ALL to population, you can bet that very strong forces are working against that representative sample, preventing it from looking like the wider population"

"That kind of finding doesn’t happen naturally. This usually means something systemic, an external force like enforced segegation, active gatekeeping, economic restrictions or policies are acting on that sample, creating that skew, and keeping members of the wider population away"
