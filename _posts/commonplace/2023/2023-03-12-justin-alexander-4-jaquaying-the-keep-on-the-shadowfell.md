"What I’m going to do is take a few simple jaquaying techniques and use them to tweak the Keep of the Shadowfell in order to make it a more dynamic and interesting dungeon"

"If this entrance is found before the PCs enter the Keep, it’s a nice reward for their cleverness and preparation. If it’s found during their explorations of the Keep, it can provide a valuable avenue of escape or allow them to sneak back into the complex after a guard has been raised at the primary entrance"

"**ADDING A STAIRCASE**:"

"My primary motivation here is to remove some of the dead ends from the dungeon. By linking two of the dead ends together, I’m creating a dynamic loop"

"**ADDING A SECRET PASSAGE**:"

"This provides a second connection to the lower level, providing the dungeon with important multiple connections between levels"

"**MOVING A STAIRCASE**:"

"The primary reason for this shift is to open up some real estate between the primary and secondary routes leading to the lower level"
