"The dungeons of *Dark Tower* are incredibly ingenious in their design, with myriad and varied connections between their levels. In practice, however, the presentation of the dungeon can be somewhat murky, and a DM can easily find themselves trying to riddle out the basic function of the dungeon."

"**DUNGEON OVERVIEW  
**

If you look at the side view of the dungeon above, there are a few key features and clarifications to immediately note."

"First, there are multiple entrances leading from the village into the dungeon below."

"Second, there are four levels to the dungeon. There are multiple connections between these levels, but the progression is linear"

"Third, let’s consider the two towers. Broadly speaking, you can enter Mitra’s Tower at the top of the dungeon and exit it on the bottom. The entrance to Set’s Tower, on the other hand, is most easily entered from the bottom level and then climbed to its top."

"Finally — and this is of particular importance! — the side view of the dungeon is incorrect! Although Level 2 is depicted as intersecting Levels K and C of the towers, it actually intersects Levels I & D"
