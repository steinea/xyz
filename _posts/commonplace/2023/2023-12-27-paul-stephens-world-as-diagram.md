"The show takes its title from Thomas Hirschhorn’s *Schema: Art and Public Space* (2016–22), an exuberant multimedia collage-manifesto"

"Rudimentary and improvisational, Hirschhorn’s patchwork of ideas and contexts places the works in the show under a utopian-communitarian umbrella—exemplifying David Joselit’s claim in his 2005 essay “Dada’s Diagrams” that “the diagram constitutes an embodied utopianism.”"

"Hirschhorn’s *Schema* might usefully be juxtaposed with Dan Graham’s 1966 work of the same name—sometimes taken to represent the apex of early informatic anti-figural conceptualism"

"Graham intended his work to be “completely self-referential” and meant to define “itself in place only as information.”"

"In the terms of Bernar Venet—the artist included in the show whose informatic work perhaps resembles Graham’s most closely—the latter’s *Schema* is austerely monosemic while Hirschhorn’s is ebulliently polysemic"
