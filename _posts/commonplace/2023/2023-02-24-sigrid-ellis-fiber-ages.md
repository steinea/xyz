"I am reading [*The Golden Thread: How Fabric Changed History*](https://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Golden_Thread_How_Fabric_Changed_His.html?id=VweLDwAAQBAJ), by Kassia St. Clair. I'm on page 21. I am already incensed at the perception of history I was taught for 35 years of my life.

Stone Age. Bronze Age. Iron Age.

Those are the tools that survived, yes. But what those tools were for was the Twisted Fiber Age. The Linen Age. The Wool Age.

We then entered the Cotton Age, riding the backs of global colonization and industry. Now we are in the Petrochemical Age."
