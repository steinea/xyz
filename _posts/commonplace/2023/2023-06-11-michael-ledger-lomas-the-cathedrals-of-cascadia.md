"To visit Stanley Park, the Mohawk poet Pauline Johnson wrote over a century ago in *Legends of Vancouver*, was to enter an “atmosphere of holiness.”"

"For the sociologist Paul Bramadat, the concept of reverential naturalism — a “way of physically being, or being physical, in a particular geography”— best evokes the distinctive relationship between institutional religion, spirituality, and nature in Canada’s Pacific Northwest"

"Cascadia is not just a geographical designation; it is a “storied place,” the majesty of whose mountains, forests, and oceans predisposes its inhabitants to find spiritual significance in nature"

"With *Religion at the Edge: Nature, Spirituality, and Secularity in the Pacific Northwest*, Bramadat and his collaborators have given us a clutch of rich essays on the world views of Cascadia, drawing on a rigorous statistical survey by Sarah Wilkins-Laflamme and panel interviews in its urban cores"
