"The alphabet, they say, was invented only once. Bread is invented every time, anew. It's life itself. And life is not for sale"

"Breadpunk rejects the commoditization of life by market capitalism"

"Breadpunk is an attitude that something our ancestors made largely for free is not something we should be spending money on"

"Breadpunk is simple: **MAKE YOUR OWN DAMN BREAD**"
