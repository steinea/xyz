"**Conceptual engineering** is a field in [analytic philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_philosophy) that focuses on how to best assess and improve our [conceptual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept) schemes and repertoires. One of its key features is its [normative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative) agenda: conceptual engineers aim to prescribe which concepts we *ought to* have and use, instead of merely describing those we have and use"

"The most standard reference in the literature is to [Rudolf Carnap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Carnap)'s notion of [explication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explication#Carnap's_notion_of_explication) as a precursory method of conceptual engineering for theoretical purposes"

"Conceptual engineering can be understood in terms of its three components: design, which is about the normative improvement of our concepts; implementation, which is about the actual uptake of the prescribed concepts via advocacy strategies; and evaluation, which is about the quality assessment of our concepts along different dimensions"
