"Few concepts destroy the minds of fair-minded people like the concept of the backlog"

"Like many things in *theory,* backlogs are a fine idea. Our time is finite and so having some structure and intentionality around what we intend to do is a reasonable proposition, albeit one that falls apart quickly when it meets the lived world"

"I think backlogs are harmful and encourage unhelpful habits"

"We should resist the way capitalism makes us inclined to treat our leisure and rest time as something to be made efficient and optimised through the lens of productivity. What we do for fun shouldnâ€™t be work. Backlogs, in their essence, are to do lists intended to optimise the time you are meant to be relaxing and enjoying life"

"A backlog merely captures our preferences and desires of a specific moment in the past, which is perhaps a neat time capsule, but not something that serves us to live in the moment. Relying on backlogs implies that the decisions we made in the past are somehow more important than the decisions we are making right now in the moment"
