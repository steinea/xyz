"I briefly used what I dubbed Melan diagrams — a technique created in 2006 by Melan for [a thread on ENWorld](https://web.archive.org/web/20150926064945/http:/www.enworld.org/forum/showthread.php?168563-Dungeon-layout-map-flow-and-old-school-game-design) where he discussed “map flow and old school game design.”"

"as Melan said in his original post:

> [They are] a graphical method which “distils” the dungeon into a kind of decision tree or flowchart by stripping away “noise.” On the resulting image, meandering corridors and even smaller room complexes are turned into straight lines. Although the image doesn’t create an “accurate” representation of the dungeon map, and is by no means a “scientific” depiction, it demonstrates what kind of [navigational] decisions the players can make while moving through the dungeon."

"By getting rid of the “noise” you can boil a dungeon down to its essential structure. They also allow you to compare the structures of different dungeons at a glance."

"It’s fairly important to note that you don’t actually use Melan diagrams for designing dungeons. They are an *analytical* tool, not a design tool: You use them to look at something which has already been created, not to create it in the first place."

"**STRAIGHTEN THE LINE  
**

The first principle of making a Melan diagram is to eliminate all the irrelevant twists-and-turns on the map"

"FORK THE PATH"

"**ELIMINATE SIDE CHAMBERS  
**

“Wait another minute!” you cry. “I can see other doors that you’re ignoring!”

The second principle of a Melan diagram is that we are going to eliminate all paths that are only one chamber deep."

"Melan diagrams will introduce superfluous ninety-degree turns in order to keep the diagrams relatively compact or to conveniently make room for other paths.

So if you see a turn on a Melan diagram that doesn’t have a second path branching from it, you’ll know that it’s purely cosmetic"

"**ELIMINATE FAKE LOOPS  
**

Dungeon paths will, of course, form loops. In fact, a well-designed, jaquayed dungeon will probably feature LOTS of loops"

"this is indicated with a dotted line on the Melan diagram"

"**LEVEL CONNECTIONS  
**

The last functional element of a Melan diagram are the connections between levels. When a path goes from one level of the dungeon to another (by stair, elevator, sloping ramp, teleporter, or whatever), this is indicated by a break in the line with terminating lines on either side"

"**OTHER ELEMENTS  
**

Melan diagrams may also include labels (e.g., “Goblins” or “Secret Lab” or “Teleportation Trap”). These are technically non-functional parts of the diagram, but can be useful to help readers orient themselves."
