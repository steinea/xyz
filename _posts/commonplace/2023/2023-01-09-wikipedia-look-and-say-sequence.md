"In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), the **look-and-say sequence** is the [sequence of integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_sequence) beginning as follows:

1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, 312211, 13112221, 1113213211, 31131211131221, ... (sequence [A005150](https://oeis.org/A005150) in the [OEIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences))."

"To generate a member of the sequence from the previous member, read off the digits of the previous member, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit. For example:

* 1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
* 11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
* 21 is read off as "one 2, one 1" or 1211.
* 1211 is read off as "one 1, one 2, two 1s" or 111221.
* 111221 is read off as "three 1s, two 2s, one 1" or 312211."

"The look-and-say sequence was analyzed by [John Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look-and-say_sequence#cite_note-Conway-original-article-1) after he was introduced to it by one of his students at a party"

"Conway's **cosmological theorem** asserts that every sequence eventually splits ("decays") into a sequence of "atomic elements", which are finite subsequences that never again interact with their neighbors. There are 92 elements containing the digits 1, 2, and 3 only, which John Conway named after the 92 naturally-occurring [chemical elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element) up to uranium, calling the sequence **audioactive**. There are also two "[transuranic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transuranic)" elements (Np and Pu) for each digit other than 1, 2, and 3"
