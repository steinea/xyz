"Jaquaying isn’t a cure-all. But, in my experience, it does scale to almost any size and it’s almost always useful to at least *consider* jaquaying as a potential tool even if you ultimately decide against it"

"To demonstrate what I mean about using jaquaying techniques at any scale, let me give you an example at an extremely small scale to emphasize the point: A two-room “dungeon”"

"Since it’s only two rooms, there’s really no way that we could apply jaquaying techniques, right?"

"First, multiple entrances"

"Second, multiple paths"

"it does demonstrate how you can use jaquaying techniques even on the tiniest scales can organically create interesting tactical and strategic choices."
