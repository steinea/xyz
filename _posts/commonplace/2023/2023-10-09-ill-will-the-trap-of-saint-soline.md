"On March 25th, 2023, [30,000](https://twitter.com/illwilleditions/status/1639663350333296640) people descended on Sainte-Soline, France to participate in a mass sabotage action against an industrial reservoir (“mega basin”) funneling rainwater into corporate mega basins"

"At issue is a counter-insurrectionary strategy operating on three levels simultaneously: psychologically, militarily, and in the media"

"The question of whether some of the protesters were possible “cop killers” was calmly debated on television platforms. On BFMTV it was admitted that no firearm was ever found during a protest, and even that the “literature” of the “Black Bloc” does not call for murder as a practice. So what? The term murderer is “discussed” anyway, and thus placed on the table. As a climax, we even heard it uttered by the Minister of the Interior himself"

"In this way, an enemy was created: a bloodthirsty beast excluded from the human community. It’s now about announcing its future appearances"

"At Sainte-Soline there were not just the abuses of a few. It was not *one* officer using his weapon against regulation. Instead there was a methodical, meticulous, and systematic apparatus that aimed to altogether crush, wound, and terrorize the protesters, whoever they were"

"the goal is to kill two birds with one stone: to stop the ecological movements and the social movement at the same time. To traumatize the protesters in the fields, while frightening those in the cities, so that the mobilization of one ceases to feed into the other"
