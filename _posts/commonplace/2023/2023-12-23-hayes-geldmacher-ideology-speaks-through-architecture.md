"Space is perhaps represented most truthfully, and with the fewest barriers to expression, in videogames"

"*Inside* demonstrates the depths of oppressive architectural language"

"*Gorogoa* does the opposite by elevating space beyond the physical into the cosmic"

"While *Inside’s* spaces may feel empty and cruel, *Gorogoa’s* are intimate and packed with transcendental meaning"

"*Inside* takes place in a bitter dystopia where a faceless young boy in a red shirt struggles against the inevitable end, and the hollow architectural sprawl conveys that ideology without a single word"

"*Gorogoa* takes place at the center point of a spiritual crossroads where a faceless young boy in a red shirt becomes something more than they ever could have dreamed, and the flowing intimacy between each space reflects that"

"*Inside* sprints and slides ever-downward, while *Gorogoa* carefully climbs a spiral staircase"
