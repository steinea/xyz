"*Trophy Dark* impeccably spins tales that structurally and tonally align with films like [*Annihilation*](http://polygon.com/2018/2/21/17036936/annihilation-movie-review-2018-natalie-portman-alex-garland), *Apocalypse Now*, and *A Field in England*"

"*Trophy Dark* has arrived, and it’s as wondrous as it is poetic"

"*Trophy Dark* is very progressive. In addition to constantly calling for player input and beckoning them to flesh out their characters and the haunted world, the rules text also addresses issues of consent and troubling content. An entire section of the book brings thoughtful guidance on the necessary discussion and caution surrounding the dark places the narrative may go. It’s refreshing how forthright the author is with a sensitive topic"
