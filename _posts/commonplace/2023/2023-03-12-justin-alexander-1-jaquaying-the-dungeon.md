"the term is referring to Jennell Jaquays, who designed *[Caverns of Thracia](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000YBFHEE/digitalcomi0a-20)*, *[Dark Tower](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0023SSJR8/digitalcomi0a-20)*, *[Griffin Mountain](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000F3N8SS/digitalcomi0a-20)*, and a half dozen other old school classics for Judges Guild, Chaosium, Flying Buffalo, and TSR before transitioning into video game design"

"What Jaquays particularly excelled at in those early Judges Guild modules was non-linear dungeon design"

"Each group is actively making the dungeon their own. They can retreat, circle around, rush ahead, go back over old ground, poke around, sneak through, interrogate the locals for secret routes… The possibilities are endless because the environment isn’t forcing them along a pre-designed path. And throughout it all, the players are experiencing the thrill of truly exploring the dungeon complex"

"In practice, the complexity of a jaquayed dungeon emerges from the same simple structures that make up a linear dungeon: The room the PCs are currently in has one or more exits. What are they going to do in this room? Which exit are they going to take?"

"In a linear dungeon, the pseudo-choices the PCs make will lead them along a pre-designed, railroad-like route. In a jaquayed dungeon, on the other hand, the choices the PCs make will have a meaningful impact on how the adventure plays out, but the actual running of the adventure isn’t more complex as a result"
