"While it would be marvelous if something I wrote inspired & transformed others, I always settle for having that which I have written, be it poem or prose, being a maker or marker the emergence or development of an idea that has transformed me."

"I often worry that I haven't written books that many others will value, & yet, when I return to my books, in the experience of re-reading them, I always find myself saying, 'Ah, yes, that was when & where I learned & grew & stumbled upon this or that condition or constraint.'"

"Editing my next book for publication, I am struggling with the fact that I really want more people to value this book,  but, at the same time, I am really taking a great deal of pride in how much I pushed my self to learn, & grow, & stumble upon difficult & disturbing realities."
