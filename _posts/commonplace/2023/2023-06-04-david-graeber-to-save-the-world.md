"Work is our badge of moral citizenship. We seem to have convinced ourselves as a society that anyone who isn’t working harder than they would like to be working, at something they don’t enjoy, is a bad, unworthy person. As a result, work comes to absorb ever greater proportions of our energy and time"

"Much of this work is entirely pointless"

"The system makes no sense. It’s also [destroying the plane](https://wordpress.bigissue.com/opinion/climate-concern-is-distinctly-unremarkable-why-is-not-more-being-done/)t. If we don’t break ourselves of this addiction quickly we will leave our children and grandchildren to face catastrophes on a scale which will make the current pandemic seem trivial"

"we’re constantly encouraged to look at social problems as if they were questions of personal morality"

"It’s not our pleasures that are destroying the world. It’s our puritanism, our feeling that we have to suffer in order to deserve those pleasures. If we want to save the world, we’re going to have to stop working"

"Why [destroy the world](https://wordpress.bigissue.com/latest/when-it-comes-to-climate-the-future-generations-pledge-is-the-only-way/) if you don’t have to?"
