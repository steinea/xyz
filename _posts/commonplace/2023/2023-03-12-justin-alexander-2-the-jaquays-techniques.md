"**MULTIPLE ENTRANCES**: Multiple entrances give the PCs an immediate strategic choice as they approach the dungeon complex"

"**LOOPS**: Branching paths in a dungeon allow for choice, but are still functionally linear in their design"

"Where things get interesting is when you grab a couple of those branches and hook them together into a loo"

"**MULTIPLE LEVEL CONNECTIONS**: If there is only a single route leading to the next level of the dungeon the complexity of the current level is collapsed into a chokepoint. But if you introduce multiple connections between the dungeon levels you create a synergy between complex level designs"

"**DISCONTINUOUS LEVEL CONNECTIONS**: In a linear design, the levels of a dungeon must proceed in their predetermined order"

"But once you introduce multiple connections between levels, you are free to have some of those connections skip levels"

"**SECRET & UNUSUAL PATHS**: These are fairly self-explanatory. They reward curiosity and exploration, and can also breathe fresh life into areas of the dungeon which have already been traversed."

"**SUB-LEVELS**: The distinction between a “level” and a “sub-level” is somewhat arbitrary, but perhaps the defining characteristic of the sub-level is that it departs from the main “sequence” of the dungeon. It may be smaller than the other levels of the dungeon; it may be difficult to reach; or both. As such, sub-levels serve as boulevards of discovery or elaborate shortcuts (or both)."

"**DIVIDED LEVELS**: Similar to the concept of a sub-level is that of the divided level. While existing within the main “sequence” of the dungeon, a divided level cannot be completely traversed without going through the levels above or below it."

"**NESTED DUNGEONS**: Nested dungeons are sort of like sub-levels or divided levels on steroids. Imagine designing two separate and distinct dungeon complexes, but then linking them together at selected locations"

"**MINOR ELEVATION SHIFTS**: When the PCs come to a staircase they may naturally assume that they are going up or down to a new level of the dungeon. But by including minor elevation shifts within the topography of a single dungeon level you can confound their expectations"

"**MIDPOINT ENTRY**: I don’t think Jaquays ever used this technique, but you can complicate the players’ approach to the dungeon by creating immediate bilateral exploration"

"**NON-EUCLIDIAN GEOMETRY**: If you want to have some real fun, consider using non-Euclidian geometry. These Escher-inspired designs can result in counter-intuitive navigation and may even result in PCs moving between levels without realizing that it’s happened"

"**EXTRADIMENSIONAL SPACES**: Sections of a dungeon complex may lead into areas completely beyond the dungeon itself while still remaining intimately tied to the dungeon’s topography and/or experience."
