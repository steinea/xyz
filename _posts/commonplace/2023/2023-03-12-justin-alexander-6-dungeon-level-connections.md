"Many of the [Jaquays Techniques](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/13103/roleplaying-games/jaquaying-the-dungeon-part-2-the-jaquays-techniques) deal with elaborating, enumerating, or complicating the transitions between levels. So let’s take a moment to consider the many different ways in which levels can be connected to each other."

"**STAIRS**: The very first level connector mentioned in all of D&D"

"**SLOPES**: Similar to stairs, but without the stairs"

"**CHUTES**: Vertical passages that cannot be traversed on foot"

"**LADDERS**: Like a chute, but with a climbing aid already onsite"

"**TRAPDOORS**: Trapdoors may lead to stairs, slopes, chutes, or ladders, but they may also taunt PCs from the middle of a ceiling. Or drop down directly into a lower chamber"

"**WINDOWS**: In *[Dark Tower](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0023SSJR8/digitalcomi0a-20)*, Jaquays gives us a window looking down into a lower level of the dungeon"

"**TELEPORTS**: Teleportation effects allow for rapid transit through larger dungeon complexes, but also have the potential to leave PCs disoriented until they can re-orient themselves at the other end"

"**TRAPS**: Pit traps that drop PCs into an underground river three levels below"

"**MULTI-LEVEL CHAMBERS**: Large, vertical chambers can contain entrances leading to different levels within the dungeon"

"**ELEVATORS**: In their most basic configuration elevators are chutes with a self-propelling means of passage"

"**BASKET AND PULLEY**: These are similar to elevators in their operation, but have the distinction of allowing their passengers to directly observe their surroundings for the duration of their trip"

"**ETHEREAL TRAVEL**: Sections of the dungeon in which normally solid obstacles (like the floor) can be moved through by way of the Ethereal Plane"

"**RIVERS**: A natural variant of the slope. If the river runs flush with the walls, however, getting back upstream may require some tricky swimming"

"**UNDERWATER**: In the real world, the fluid level in any connected system [has to be the same](http://www.darthsanddroids.net/episodes/0035.html), which means that underwater journeys will be most useful in moving PCs across divided levels, nested levels, or to sub-levels on the same horizontal plane of the dungeon"

"However, magic, alchemy, and steampunk technology can provide any number of airlocks and semi-permeable barriers allowing for underwater dives to the depths of an otherwise dry dungeon"

"**COLLAPSED PASSAGES**: A variant on any chute, stair, shaft, slope, or passage"

"**TRANSPORT**: Think Charon on the River Styx"

"**BEING SWALLOWED**: “The cave is collapsing.” “This is no cave.”"

"**BRUTE FORCE**: Tunneling through walls using a stone shape spell. Levitating or flying through “unreachable” vertical passages. Using gaseous form to traverse “impassable” air vents"
