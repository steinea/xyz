"Intrusive transplant,
invasive colonial
transported here
to inscribe boundaries,
borders, windbreaks

But today you are brilliant with
April's newest shades---
lime, mint, fern.
Your tufted buds ruff out tiny fans
at the tips of young twigs
against the sky.

House sparrows accept
your branches
cheerful
among their slender lace---
colonists themselves,
dreadfully successful
around the globe.

How long does it take to belong?
after you've muscled in,
altered everything
past changing back,
irrevocable.

Caragana,
born of the boreal rim,
north's circle
of steppe and grassland
continuous across continents.

The light here feels like home."
