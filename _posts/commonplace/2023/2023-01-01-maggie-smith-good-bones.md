Life is short, though I keep this from my children.
<br>Life is short, and I’ve shortened mine
<br>in a thousand delicious, ill-advised ways,
<br>a thousand deliciously ill-advised ways
<br>I’ll keep from my children. The world is at least
<br>fifty percent terrible, and that’s a conservative
<br>estimate, though I keep this from my children.
<br>For every bird there is a stone thrown at a bird.
<br>For every loved child, a child broken, bagged,
<br>sunk in a lake. Life is short and the world
<br>is at least half terrible, and for every kind
<br>stranger, there is one who would break you,
<br>though I keep this from my children. I am trying
<br>to sell them the world. Any decent realtor,
<br>walking you through a real shithole, chirps on
<br>about good bones: This place could be beautiful,
<br>right? You could make this place beautiful.
