"All human activity can be understood in relation to labor and creativity"

"Creative labor always produces a transformation in the world.

This is not only a human concept.

There can be the creative labor of an electron, of a biological cell, of a celestial body, and of humans.

Creative labor brings transformation into the Universe.

Creative labor can bend time, reverse time, disrupt time"

"Every spatio-temporal process is a product of a particular multitude. This multitude is made up of many elements unified by a certain principal"

"If we imagine a still image of the world, then time, which is change and transformation, is expressed in the totality of relationships between elements"

"If two moments had the same combination of elements, they would be identical. A resurrection of a person could be a repetition of the combination of all elements of their body and their relation to the multitude"

"In order to defeat time, one needs to either repeat everything that happened previously, or force the multitude into a desired combination"
