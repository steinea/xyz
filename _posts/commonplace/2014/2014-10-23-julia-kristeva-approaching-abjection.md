“Apprehensive, desire turns aside; sickened, it rejects” (1). 

“The abject has only one quality of the object—that of being opposed to I” (1).

“Not me. Not that. But not nothing, either. A “something” that I do not recognize as a thing” (2).

“Food loathing is perhaps the most elementary and most archaic form of abjection” (2).
