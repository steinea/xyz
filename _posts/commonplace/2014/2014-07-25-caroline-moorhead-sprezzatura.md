"esprit, wit, with all its various nuances, somewhere between impertinence and adulation, designed above all to give pleasure to your riends." 

"sprezzatura, the handling of the complexities of life with a light and nonchalant touch, a “studied carelessness”, was a much recommended Renaissance skill."

"bella figura, making the right and stylish gesture"
