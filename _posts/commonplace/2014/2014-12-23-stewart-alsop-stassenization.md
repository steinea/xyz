"In a Column entitled "Stassenization", Stewart Alsop invents the verb "to stassenize", and uses it to describe candidates who run for the Presidency without having any chance of winning. According to Alsop "There are no fewer than five stassenized politicians running this year: McCarthy, George Wallace, Vance Hartke, George McGovern and (although there are those who would strongly deny it) good old Hubert Humphrey" (9)."
