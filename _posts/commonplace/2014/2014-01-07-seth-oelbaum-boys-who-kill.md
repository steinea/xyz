"Arthur Schopenhauer’s idea of the commendable author. For the German philosophy boy, there are three types of writers: 1) the one who writes without thinking; 2) the one who writes while thinking; 3) the one who writes after thinking. The first two are stupid and the third is splendid, since, according to Arthur, composing under the third circumstance is like participating in a chase where the game has already been captured so all you have to do is shoot it. The purpose has been determined; what’s left is to carry it out. Arthur’s main purpose was to explain why the world is motored by will."
