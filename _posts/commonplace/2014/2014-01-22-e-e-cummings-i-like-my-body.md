i like my body when it is with your
<br>body.    It is so quite a new thing.
<br>Muscles better and nerves more.
<br>i like your body.    i like what it does,
<br>i like its hows.    i like to feel the spine
<br>of your body and its bones,and the trembling
<br>-firm-smooth ness and which I will
<br>again and again and again
<br>kiss,    i like kissing this and that of you,
<br>i like,slowly stroking the, shocking fuzz
<br>of your electric fur,and what-is-it comes
<br>over parting flesh...And eyes big love-crumbs,

and possibly i like the thrill

of under me you quite so new
