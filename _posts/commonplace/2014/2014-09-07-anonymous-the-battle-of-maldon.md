Hige sceal þē heardra, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; heorte þē cēnre,
<br>mōd sceal þē māre, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; þē ūre mægen lytlað.

Thought shall be harder, heart the keener,
<br>Mood the more, as our might lessens.

Line 312; translation from Michael Alexander The Earliest English Poems (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1975) p. 112.

or

Will must be the harder, courage the bolder,
<br>spirit must be the more, as our might lessens.
