I.

It comforts them to think that we embark
<br> in pairs, shuffling into the hold
<br> of the boat, this creaking ark—
<br> they who go solus
<br> into the dark.

II.

Noah and Missus standing at the rail; their animals;
<br> their children, also, two by two.
<br> Circumscribing the scene—
<br> a foregone conclusion?—
<br> the rainbow.

III.

Without form and void, as at the get-go:
<br> that is all the tidings it is given
<br> to me to break. Let
<br> it be, Love.
<br> Light.
