I was reading up on my Hellenic math: no zero yet, no 
<br>transfinite set theory, no sine or cosine, just a Brotherhood that 
<br>felt divine to its practitioners. You were back in California, 
<br>riding on the waves, your father gone awhile, and me, you said, 
<br>no consolation outside of the bed. I’ve never yet let go of zero, 
<br>the multiplier best employed on incommensurate sums, either 
<br>one on top a lovelier ratio, but when divided through becomes a 
<br>number that can’t compute but instead goes on, in proof, 
<br>diminished by each digit that it spews. 

Eudoxus did not quite anticipate you, a curve that skims but 
<br>will not touch the bottom line. And then the Romans came, and 
<br>all was lost for quite some time.
