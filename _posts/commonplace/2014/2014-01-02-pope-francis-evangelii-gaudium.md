6. Joy adapts and changes, but it always endures, even as a flicker of light born of our personal certainty that, when everything is said and done, we are infinitely loved.

7. I never tire of repeating those words of Benedict XVI which take us to the very heart of the Gospel: “Being a Christian is not the result of an ethical choice or a lofty idea, but the encounter with an event, a person, which gives life a new horizon and a decisive direction”.

8. We become fully human when we become more than human, when we let God bring us beyond ourselves in order to attain the fullest truth of our being.

24. Evangelization consists mostly of patience and disregard for constraints of time.
