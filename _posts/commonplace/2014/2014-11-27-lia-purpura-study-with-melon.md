The stem end of a melon	
<br>is weblike, form	
<br>finding a pattern	
<br>thatâ€™s thinking itself	
<br>a density	
<br>a concentration	
<br>beginning a line	
<br>then casting it out	
<br>and moving on from,	
<br>an order established, 
<br>a gesture complete.	
<br>Completion: how 
<br>someone at a distance	
<br>might see it.
