Better, obviously, is something like this: “A Short Manifesto” (1964) by the Dutch conceptual artist Stanley Brouwn. It ends with a vision of the future, in 4,000 AD:

                 NO MUSIC

                 NO THEATRE

                 NO ART

                 NO

                 THERE WILL BE SOUND

                                                COLOR

                                                LIGHT           

                                                SPACE

                                                TIME

                                                MOVEMENT

A Short Manifesto

4000 A.D.
<br>WHEN SCIENCE AND ART ARE ENTIRELY
<br>MELTED TOGETHER TO SOMETHING NEW
<br>WHEN PEOPLE WILL HAVE LOST THEIR
<br>REMEMBRANCE AND THUS WILL HAVE
<br>NO PAST, ONLY FUTURE.
<br>WHEN THEY WILL HAVE TO DISCOVER EVERYTHING EVERY MOMENT AGAIN AND AGAIN
<br>WHEN THEY WILL HAVE LOST THEIR NEED FOR CONTACT WITH OTHERS 

. . .

THEN THEY WILL LIVE IN A WORLD OF ONLY
<br>COLOUR, LIGHT, SPACE, TIME, SOUNDS AND MOVEMENT THEN COLOUR LIGHT SPACE TIME
<br>SOUNDS AND MOVEMENT WILL BE FREE
<br>NO MUSIC
<br>NO THEATER
<br>NO ART
<br>NO
<br>THERE WILL BE SOUND
<br>COLOUR LIGHT SPACE
<br>TIME MOVEMENT
