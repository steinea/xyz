Cutlery does not a home make
<br>though an extra spoon
<br>comes in handy.

New curtains do not a home make
<br>though some windows
<br>are best covered.

For a home to be a home,
<br>you need many items 
<br>you’d rather have discarded. 

What Eskimos advise:
<br>build a sturdy igloo with
<br>snow in your shoes;

the safety pin, forgotten
<br>in the coat collar,
<br>at your jugular.

(Translated, from the Serbian, by Steven and Maja Teref.)
