“Crummey’s novels have tended to be crowded with stories and characters, maybe because he grew up in small communities in which everybody knows everybody else, and their stories. (Novels by urbanites are more solitary, driven inward by the solipsism it takes to survive cities too big to know.)”

“Maybe Newfoundland has its own dictionary because words matter more when they refer only to the world before you, when the truth is just a story.”
