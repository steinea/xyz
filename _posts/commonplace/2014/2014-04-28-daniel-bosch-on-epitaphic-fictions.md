Witness this epitaph in the collection of the Yale Library, from an autograph manuscript composed circa 1728:

    The Body of
    B. Franklin,

    Printer;

    Like the Cover of an old Book,

    Its Contents torn out,

    And Stript of its Lettering and Gilding,

    Lies here, Food for Worms.

    But the Work shall not be wholly lost:

    For it will, as he believ’d, appear once more,

    In a new & more perfect Edition,

    Corrected and Amended

    By the Author.

    He was born Jan. 6. 1706.

    Died                    17


“An epitaph typically reinforces values we look for in strong poems: gravity, brevity, levity, and the authority of the speaker’s experience, granted in epitaph’s special case by his death. Franklin is ahead of himself in his rock-solid grasp of these conventions.”
