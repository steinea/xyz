They fuck you up, your mum and dad.   
<br>They may not mean to, but they do.   
<br>They fill you with the faults they had 
<br>And add some extra, just for you. 

But they were fucked up in their turn 
<br>By fools in old-style hats and coats,   
<br>Who half the time were soppy-stern 
<br>And half at one another’s throats. 

Man hands on misery to man. 
<br>It deepens like a coastal shelf. 
<br>Get out as early as you can, 
<br>And don’t have any kids yourself.
