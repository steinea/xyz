God is the "Helm of all created things" (4).

"The Lord of life gave both [shadow and light] a name. By the word of God the gleaming light was first called day" (4).

"All-wielding God" (6).

"Many a crafty speech [Satan] knew, many a crooked word" (10).

"The other tree was dark, sunless, and full of shadows: that was the tree of death. Bitter the fruit it bore!" Interesting change. Though it does lead to death in the Hebrew, it is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which Eve says is fair to look on. This seems a significant emendation. Every man who tastes it must know good and evil, the Old English says, but that follows choosing death, not vice versa.

"From that shoot [Abel's "blood poured out in murder" (20)] grew more and more a deadly bitter fruit, and the boughs of sin stretched far and wide among the nations; grievously the twigs of evil touched the sons of man (and do so yet), and from them grew broad blades of wickedness" (20).
