When the corn gave,
<br> a boy was sucked to the bottom
<br> of the cement silo whose walls
<br> he was paid almost nothing
<br> to scrape clean with a steel pole. 
<br> It took thirty-five men to pull his body
<br> from the outlet spout.

Corn had plugged his nostrils,
<br> ears, and throat as far down
<br> as his lungs. In the calf barn,
<br> rescuers cleared the field
<br> of his face, a few fistfuls of grain
<br> a calf sluggishly ate
<br> on its way out to pasture.

In the Iliad, the moment Dolon,
<br> young, ugly, volunteered
<br> to spy on the Argives when
<br> no one else would, he was doomed
<br> to have his weasel cap stripped 
<br> while his head rolled into a trench 
<br> darkened with other sons’ blood

where his mouth would slowly fill
<br> with blades of grass.
