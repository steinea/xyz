“At the Center for the Study of Science Fiction, we feel it's important to understand the foundations of SF Studies, and that begins with knowing everyone's talking about the same thing.”

“Science fiction is the literature of of the human species encountering change, whether it arrives via scientific discoveries, technological innovations, natural events, or societal shifts.”

“Science fiction is the literature of ideas and philosophy, answering such questions as, "What if?" or "If this goes on...," and is thus sometimes more interested with exploring ideas than developing plot or character, if the memes and ideas under examination are powerful enough to sustain the work.”

“Science fiction is multi- and interdisciplinary, concerned not only with literary qualities but also exploring core values of diverse fields.”

“Like the scientific method, science fiction provides an approach to understanding the universe we live in.”

“Science fiction is also the literature of the Other, providing alternate points of view on familiar topics in order to give us a clearer perspective.”

“Science fiction is a community of thinkers and creatives.”
