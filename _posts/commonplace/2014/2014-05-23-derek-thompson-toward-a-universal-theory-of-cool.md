“a new paper by Caleb Warren and Margaret C. Campbell applies a more constrictive definition that proves surprisingly workable: "Coolness is a subjective, positive trait perceived in people, brands, products, and trends that are autonomous in an appropriate way.”

If funny is a benign violation of expectations, cool is a measured violation of malign expectations.

Cool means departing from norms that we consider unnecessary, illegitimate, or repressive—but also doing so in ways that are bounded. The 1984 Apple ad that said, essentially, "you have a choice; don't buy IBM!" was considered one of the coolest commercials of all time, because it was, in the researchers words, "autonomous in an appropriate way." But a 1984 Apple ad saying "you have a choice; don't pay federal income taxes!" wouldn't be cool, because taxes are legitimate; and a 1984 Apple ad saying "burn IBM's headquarters to the ground!" wouldn't be cool, because that's just overdoing it. Cool requires a bit of Goldilocks.”
