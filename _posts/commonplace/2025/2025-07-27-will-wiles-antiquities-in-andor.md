"an antiquities emporium in the metropole is an impeccably *imperial* space."

"As architectural historian Tim Anstey writes in his recent book *Things That Move*, a placid, static setting for antiquities has within it the ghost of much movement and upheaval: ‘Vases had to be purchased, messages sent, ships chartered, admirals persuaded auctioneers primed, landscapes surveyed, and enemies foiled within the system of mechanics that made the architecture of the interior important.’"

"The trade in antiquities in the age of empires here on Earth has always had a tendency to follow upheaval, and we can imagine that is also the case in a galaxy far, far away."
