"Philosophers of logic have become increasingly interested in the question of how many of the multitude of available logics give a correct, or true, account of deductive validity."

"In their monograph *One True Logic,* Owen Griffiths and A.C. Paseau argue that the answer has to be: exactly one."

"They argue, further, that any candidate for the One True Logic (OTL) has to satisfy what they call the “L∞g∞s Hypothesis”: the OTL has to be maximally infinitary in the sense that it allows disjunctions and conjunctions over any number of formulas, as well as quantification over any number of argument places."

"The book has three parts."

"The first is concerned with the rejection of logical pluralism."

"The second develops an isomorphism invariance account of logic based on the Tarski-Sher thesis and motivates the L∞g∞s Hypothesis."

"The final part deals with objections to isomorphism invariance, defending it against other forms of invariantism as well as against worries concerning overgeneration or robustness."

"a *logic* to be a formal language and a semantics."

"Logical pluralists argue that logics usually considered to be rivals provide extensionally different but equally correct accounts of natural language consequence."
