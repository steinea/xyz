"AIâ€™s energy use already represents as much as 20 percent of global data-center power demand, [research published Thursday](https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00142-4) in the journal Joule shows. That demand from [AI](https://wired.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/), the research states, could double by the end of this year, comprising nearly half of all total data-center [electricity](https://www.wired.com/tag/electricity/) consumption worldwide, excluding the electricity used for [bitcoin](https://www.wired.com/tag/bitcoin/) mining."
