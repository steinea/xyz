"The vast majority of the environmental projects most frequently used to offset greenhouse gas emissions appear to have fundamental failings suggesting they cannot be relied upon to cut planet-heating emissions, according to a new analysis."

"there is mounting evidence suggesting that many of these offset schemes exaggerate climate benefits and underestimate potential harms."

"the Guardian and researchers from Corporate Accountability, a non-profit, transnational corporate watchdog, analysed the top 50 emission offset projects, those that have sold the most carbon credits in the global market."

"According to our research, more than a third of the top 50 projects had some evidence of three or more fundamental failings."

"Estimated to be [worth about $2bn](https://carboncredits.com/what-is-the-voluntary-carbon-market/#:~:text=As%20of%202022%2C%20the%20real,valued%20at%20around%20%242%20billion.), the voluntary carbon market (VCM) is vast, fragmented and opaque, involving a complex network of developers, registries, traders, brokers and investors that makes it difficult to track and evaluate the effectiveness – and potential harms – linked to offset projects."

"“These findings show that the VCM is flawed and basically a fraud, allowing the west to offset their emissions and continue business as usual at the expense of the global south,” said Souparna Lahiri, the New Delhi-based climate adviser for the Global Forest Coalition."

"Almost two-thirds (32/50) of the most traded projects were certified by the US-based non-profit Verra, which operates the world’s most prominent carbon standard or registry, and included 18 forest offsetting projects known as Redd+ schemes."

"Twenty-eight of the 32 Verra projects the Guardian/Corporate Accountability analysed were classified as likely junk; the other four were problematic and potentially worthless."
