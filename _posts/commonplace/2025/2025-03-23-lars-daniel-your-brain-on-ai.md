"A recent study conducted by Carnegie Mellon University and Microsoft Research offers a closer look at how knowledge workers interact with AI-generated content and the cognitive trade-offs involved. The research, based on a survey of 319 professionals, reveals a nuanced transformation: while AI can reduce the mental effort required for many tasks, it may also lead to diminished critical engagement in certain contexts."

"One of the most striking findings from the study is that 62% of participants reported engaging in less critical thinking when using AI, particularly in routine or lower-stakes tasks."

"Conversely, those who had greater confidence in their own expertise were 27% more likely to critically assess AI-generated outputs rather than accept them at face value."
