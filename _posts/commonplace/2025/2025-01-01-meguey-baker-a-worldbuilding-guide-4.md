"Finally, let’s talk “screen saver” technologies and skills. These are things that are so vital to everyday life that they slip from our consciousness unless we have clear reasons to still pay attention"

"There’s a “rule of threes” here; a healthy human can maybe survive, usually, three weeks without food, three days without water, and three minutes without air. People and things that help keep air and water and food coming on schedule can become so basic we assume they will always be there and unless we are intentional about remembering, the tendency to forget them is huge"

"Water – cleaning, carrying, washing, taking away filth"

"Food – growing, harvesting, processing, cooking, feeding, cleaning up, by-products"

"Protection from the elements – heat, cold, wind, pollution, too wet, too dry"

"We do a few things for sure in life:

•   We are born
•   We love
•   We carry stuff around a lot
•   We die"

"What vital, invisible skills do those things imply?"

"How is pregnancy and labor and delivery viewed? How are newborns cared for? What relationships are cultivated?"

"What do we make to carry things and are there cultural rules around who carries what? How do we track where things are?"

"Who cares for the sick and dying? What do we do with dead bodies? How do we mark all these occasions, the being born and loving and moving things and dying?"

"Think about how vulnerable people in our world are cared for or not, how disruptive people are regarded and held with compassion or not, how desperate people are made welcome or not. Do you want to replicate that in a world you create? Why? The steady beat I return to is “where have I not looked” and then I try to look there. If some voices seem to be missing from the story, from the world, *where are they?*"
