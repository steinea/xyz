"She seems to be asking how we might still find pleasure amid collapse—and whether it’s moral to do so when so many are just trying to survive."

"catastrophe, we’re reminded, is bookended by the needs of the present, interrupted by the cravings of one’s palate."

"Because she can no longer take her beloved ingredients or sunlight or clean air for granted, she decides to allow herself to want “recklessly, immorally” by taking a job as a private chef in a gated European mountaintop community of the ultra-wealthy."

"When she arrives at the Italian-French border, the narrator learns that the place is called *Terra di latte e miele*—“the land of milk and honey”—and that her role is to prepare elaborate meals for investors."

"Zhang poses complex questions about self-interest. She asks the reader to consider how meaningful individual behavior actually is when the environment continues to decay, regardless of whether one tries to do the right thing."

"In allowing her narrator to abandon herself to desire, Zhang seems to be arguing that pleasure is an essential part of life—and of survival. Our desire is what makes us human; we don’t cease wanting just because it is selfish or futile."
