"The EU’s new [sustainable finance strategy](https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/210706-sustainable-finance-strategy_en) and [Green Bond Standard](https://ec.europa.eu/finance/docs/law/210704-proposal-green-bonds-standard_en.pdf) show what is at stake. Their aim is clear: to help create the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. But the way that sustainability is defined will determine whether such schemes succeed or fail."

"investment-level classification: how can investments with good system-level impacts be separated from those with bad ones?"

"this can only be achieved with a degree of central planning."

"Tackling climate change requires transforming at least five provisioning systems: energy, transport, buildings, industry and agriculture. The price mechanism struggles with coordinating rapid transformation at this scale."

"Instead of waiting for the market to speak, a planning body — whose composition and accountability require careful consideration — should formulate plans for each of the five systems, which should then be translated into project-level criteria for sustainable investments."

"The EU’s sustainable finance strategy represents this approach in embryonic form. Its heart is a taxonomy: a [list of criteria](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:d84ec73c-c773-11eb-a925-01aa75ed71a1.0021.02/DOC_2&format=PDF) that individual activities, such as electricity generation or construction, must meet in order to be considered sustainable."
