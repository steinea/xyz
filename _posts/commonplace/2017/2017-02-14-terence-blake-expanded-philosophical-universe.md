“It is by now generally admitted that François Laruelle has never really read Badiou, and in fact he has never seriously pretended to. His polemical book ANTI-BADIOU, devoted to a quantum deconstruction of Badiou’s philosophy, is both a philo-fiction and a philo-hoax.”

“He also seems unable to relativise his thought by situating it as a particular contribution in a wider context, and is incapable of realising that Badiou’s set theoretic and category theoretic thought does the work that he requires of his own quantum thought.”

“Ignorance, perfunctory reading, decontextualised thought, inability to relativise oneself: these are the traits of philosophical sufficiency, the fault that Laruelle sees everywhere, in everyone except himself.”

“One may contrast this state of affairs with the thought of Slavoj Zizek. In his most recent books Zizek elaborates a quantum thought that he does not oppose to Badiou’s philosophy based on set and category theory but that he puts in parallel with it.”

“Fan-English translations and discussions of Laruelle’s ideas are conducted in an incomprehensible language that only partially resembles English, but that one thinks surely means something in French.”
