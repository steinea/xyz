FACING west, from California’s shores, 
<br>Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound, 
<br>I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity, the land of migrations, look afar, 
<br>Look off the shores of my Western Sea—the circle almost circled; 
<br>For, starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere, 
<br>From Asia—from the north—from the God, the sage, and the hero, 
<br>From the south—from the flowery peninsulas, and the spice islands; 
<br>Long having wander’d since—round the earth having wander’d, 
<br>Now I face home again—very pleas’d and joyous; 
<br>(But where is what I started for, so long ago? 
<br>And why is it yet unfound?)
