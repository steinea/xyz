“This volume -- which includes revised versions of papers presented at three Italian symposia in 2012 and 2013 -- is a genuine novelty in the panorama of ancient philosophy studies.”

“Indeed, the book investigates the relationship between two philosophers who (apparently) have nothing in common: Plotinus and Epicurus. The main subject is Plotinus, particularly his critical attitude toward Epicurus and atomism more generally.”

“Given that a detailed volume dealing specifically with the doctrinal relationship between Plotinus and Epicurus was lacking, one can say that the chapters written by specialists in ancient philosophy and profitably collected by Angela Longo and Daniela Patrizia Taormina fill in a real 'black hole' in the historiography of ancient thought.”

“In his Enneads Plotinus mentions the name of Epicurus once, in Treatise 33 (Enn. II 9, 15 8), which is devoted to the refutation of the (Christian) Gnostics (cf. too Porph. Plot. 16).”

“Here Epicurus is paradoxically considered even better than the Gnostics who, with a doctrine whose roots are primarily Christological rather than stricto sensu philosophical”

“As the editors show, Plotinus is notoriously reluctant to employ direct quotations (the single mention of Epicurus is the only citation of any post-Aristotelian philosopher by Plotinus), but a careful study of his work reveals that Epicureanism is undoubtedly one of his more important polemical targets.”

“This volume thus helps to clarify the terms of this debate and, especially, to find and examine those many passages in which Plotinus deeply criticizes the materialistic philosophical positions of Epicurus, even if he does not quote him directly.”

“The book is divided into four parts: the first and shortest (Historical Overview) contains only a study that reconstructs, through the analysis of selected case studies, the destiny of Epicureanism in the Imperial Age.”

“The second part (Common Anti-Epicurean Arguments in Plotinus) is dedicated to studying the largely 'silent/tacit' presence of Epicurus in the Enneads, while the third (Plotinus' Criticism of Epicurean Doctrines) investigates passages in which Plotinus criticizes several philosophical principles of Epicurus' thought, above all his materialism and the capacity of self-determination (the clinamen doctrine).”

“Finally, the fourth part (Epicurean Elements in Plotinus: Some Instances) focuses on those texts in which Plotinus even seems to 'depend' on Epicurus from the point of view of the arguments raised by the philosopher in the elaboration of some undoubtedly significant doctrines.”
