"Assemblage theory is an ontological framework drawn from dynamical systems theory, developed by Deleuze and Guattari in A Thousand Plateus. It is a bottom up framework for analyzing social complexity by emphasizing fluidity, exchangeability, and multiple functionalities. Within a body, the relationships of components parts are not stable and fixed, but can be displaced and replaced within and among other bodies. Assemble theory treats systems through relations of exteriority and self-organization."
