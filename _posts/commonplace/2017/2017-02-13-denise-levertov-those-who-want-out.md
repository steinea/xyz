In their homes, much glass and steel. Their cars
<br> are fast—walking’s for children, except in rooms.
<br> When they take longer trips, they think with contempt
<br> of the jet’s archaic slowness. Monastic
<br> in dedication to work, they apply honed skills,
<br> impatient of less than perfection. They sleep by day
<br> when the bustle of lives might disturb their research,
<br> and labor beneath fluorescent light in controlled environments
<br> fitting their needs, as the dialects
<br> in which they converse, with each other or with 
<br> the machines (which are not called machines)
<br> are controlled and fitting. The air they breathe
<br> is conditioned. Coffee and coke keep them alert.
<br> But not one can say they don’t dream,
<br> that they have no vision. Their vision
<br> consumes them, they think all the time
<br> of the city in space, they long for the permanent colony
<br> not just a lab up there, the whole works,
<br> malls, raquet courts, hot tubs, state-of-the-art
<br> ski machines, entertainment . . . Imagine it, they think,
<br> way out there, outside of ‘nature,’ unhampered,
<br> a place contrived by man, supreme
<br> triumph of reason. They know it will happen.
<br> They do not love the earth.
