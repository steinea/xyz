What I am learning to give you is my death
<br>to set you free of me, and me from myself
<br>into the dark and the new light. Like the water
<br>of a deep stream, love is always too much. We
<br>did not make it. Though we drink till we burst
<br>we cannot have it all, or want it all.
<br>In its abundance it survives our thirst.
<br>In the evening we come down to the shore
<br>to drink our fill, and sleep, while it
<br>flows through the regions of the dark.
<br>It does not hold us, except we keep returning
<br>to its rich waters thirsty. We enter,
<br>willing to die, into the commonwealth of its joy.
