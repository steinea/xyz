“Zizek’s critique of object-oriented ontology is part of a more general project, which invites comparison with Laruelle’s expanded non-philosophical project. It involves critiquing and replacing our standard forms of ontology with something related but different that both Zizek and Laruelle call “non-standard” ontology.”

“Convergent with Zizek’s and Laruelle’s analyses and arguments I myself have proposed a critique of standard, or “synchronic” ontologies and the preliminary characterisation of a non-standard, or “diachronic” ontology.”

“This text contains the first sketch of an attempt to characterise the sort of non-standard ontology that I wish to develop. In this article I make use of the single term “diachronic” to designate an alternative to standard or classical ontologies, whereas today I prefer to spell this alternative out in terms of a cluster of traits: pluralistic, heuristic, realist, open, diachronic, empirical, apophatic, and democratic.”
