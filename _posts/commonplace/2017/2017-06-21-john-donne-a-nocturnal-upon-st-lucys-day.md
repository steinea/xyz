'Tis the year's midnight, and it is the day's,  
<br>Lucy's, who scarce seven hours herself unmasks; 
<br>         The sun is spent, and now his flasks 
<br>         Send forth light squibs, no constant rays; 
<br>                The world's whole sap is sunk; 
<br>The general balm th' hydroptic earth hath drunk, 
<br>Whither, as to the bed's feet, life is shrunk, 
<br>Dead and interr'd; yet all these seem to laugh, 
<br>Compar'd with me, who am their epitaph. 

Study me then, you who shall lovers be 
<br>At the next world, that is, at the next spring; 
<br>         For I am every dead thing, 
<br>         In whom Love wrought new alchemy. 
<br>                For his art did express 
<br>A quintessence even from nothingness, 
<br>From dull privations, and lean emptiness; 
<br>He ruin'd me, and I am re-begot 
<br>Of absence, darkness, death: things which are not. 
 
All others, from all things, draw all that's good, 
<br>Life, soul, form, spirit, whence they being have; 
<br>         I, by Love's limbec, am the grave 
<br>         Of all that's nothing. Oft a flood 
<br>                Have we two wept, and so 
<br>Drown'd the whole world, us two; oft did we grow 
<br>To be two chaoses, when we did show 
<br>Care to aught else; and often absences 
<br>Withdrew our souls, and made us carcasses. 
 
But I am by her death (which word wrongs her) 
<br>Of the first nothing the elixir grown; 
<br>         Were I a man, that I were one 
<br>         I needs must know; I should prefer, 
<br>                If I were any beast, 
<br>Some ends, some means; yea plants, yea stones detest, 
<br>And love; all, all some properties invest; 
<br>If I an ordinary nothing were, 
<br>As shadow, a light and body must be here. 

But I am none; nor will my sun renew. 
<br>You lovers, for whose sake the lesser sun 
<br>         At this time to the Goat is run 
<br>         To fetch new lust, and give it you, 
<br>                Enjoy your summer all; 
<br>Since she enjoys her long night's festival, 
<br>Let me prepare towards her, and let me call 
<br>This hour her vigil, and her eve, since this 
<br>Both the year's, and the day's deep midnight is.
