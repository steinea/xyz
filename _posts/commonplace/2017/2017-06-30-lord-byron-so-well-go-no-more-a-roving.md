So, we'll go no more a roving
<br>So late into the night,
<br>Though the heart be still as loving,
<br>And the moon be still as bright.

For the sword outwears its sheath,
<br>And the soul wears out the breast,
<br>And the heart must pause to breathe,
<br>And love itself have rest.

Though the night was made for loving,
<br>And the day returns too soon,
<br>Yet we'll go no more a roving
<br>By the light of the moon.
