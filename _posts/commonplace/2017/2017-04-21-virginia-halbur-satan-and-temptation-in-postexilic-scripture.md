1 Chronicles 21:1

“Satan stood up against Israel, and incited David to count the people of Israel.“

[Translated Satan or a satan, in the Catholic Bible]

A satan: in the parallel passage of 2 Sm 24:1, the Lord’s anger. The change in the term reflects the changed theological outlook of postexilic Israel, when evil could no longer be attributed directly to God. At an earlier period the Hebrew word satan (“adversary,” or, especially in a court of law, “accuser”), when not used of men, designated an angel who accused men before God (Jb 1:6-12; 2:1-7; Zec 3:1f). Here, as in later Judaism (Wis 2:24) and in the New Testament, satan, or the “devil” (from the Greek translation of the word), designates an evil spirit who tempts men to wrongdoing.
