“No Mastery Without Mystery: Dark Souls and the Ludic Sublime”

“by Daniel Vella”

“Abstract:”

“Prominent critical perspectives on games have adopted ontological framings of the game object, and, linked to this, a privileging of gamesâ procedural nature, focusing on the game system in itself as the source of meaning.”

“This paper argues that these discourses align with what Jacques RanciÃ¨re termed the ârepresentative regimeâ of art, and that, instead, much can be gained by adopting the perspective of the âaesthetic regimeâ, which considers the artwork not as an objective system or logos, but as an object of thought for its recipient.”

“Such an understanding allows us to align the philosophical aesthetics of Kant, Ingarden and Iser with preliminary work done in the field of game hermeneutics, with Arsenault and Perronâs concept of the âmagic cycleâ of game play, and with a phenomenological approach to the game object.”

“This will let us theorize games as aesthetic objects, mental constructs developed by the player as she engages with the unseen game system â which, in turn, allows us to suggests that what may be called the âludic sublimeâ is a crucial aesthetic moment in the playerâs engagement with a game, defined by the playerâs drive towards mastery of the game coming face-to-face with the impossibility of obtaining complete, direct knowledge of the underlying system.”

“Finally, the concept of the ludic sublime, and its aesthetic implications, will be framed through an analysis of Dark Souls that will demonstrate the aesthetic mechanisms of the ludic sublime in action.”

“Keywords: Phenomenology, hermeneutics, aesthetics, sublime, proceduralism, interpretation, Dark Souls.”
