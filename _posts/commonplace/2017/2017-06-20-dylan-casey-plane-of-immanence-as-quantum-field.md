This is just quantum field theory, conceptually. You have a field that has its own rules and structures out of which particles are the manifestation of that field. But you can never touch the field itself, except by interacting with particles. And those particles do not build up the field, they're not bricks, that then lay the pavement that the field is, they are manifestations of the field, in fact the only manifestations of the field. So in Quantum Field Theory there is a universe permeating electron field, out of which electrons are the manifestation, the instances of it, but those electrons are tied to that field, they are resonances of that field, and that's why they're tied to each other and tied to photons, etc., because those are manifestations of the underlying electromagnetic field. ...
