I

This morning my eyes are deeplocked
<br>on a whiteout sky. Prayer leaks like water
<br>from my cupped hands—I hope
<br>not to be afraid.

This morning God is obvious
<br>the snow is falling soft
<br>over a long row of poplars
<br>in parallel punctuation,
<br>To whom shall you go?
<br>By noon I give up hope.
<br>We are all dying to do the right thing.

We met at a long table and they
<br>asked what I brought to the table.
<br>I’ve seen a lot of death, I said.
<br>And that’s something, I suppose.

I remember there was a low swung moon
<br>in August, swear to God bigger
<br>than my face and red as blood.
<br>It was slowly losing ground to
<br>the deep stubble of a cornfield.
<br>I stopped the car, a blue heron was
<br>bent, listening.

 

III

One morning God spoke to me
<br>and said
<br>and said
<br>And that’s something, I suppose.

When I blow out the wick of a candle
<br>smoke curls into a language.
<br>Now the snow rises above the window seam
<br>the poplars are bowed, a whisper
<br>Whose mouth do you feed?
<br>Who do you love?
<br>And the world is quiet for a long time.
