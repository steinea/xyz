*“weh unser gutter kaspar ist tot.” — Hans Arp*

Hephaestus’s golden crutch-dolls
<br>made a fetish of weakness.

The mirror leaned on a ladder that
<br>leaned on a board that leaned on a wall.

He sued the artist for imitating his work:
<br>The artist sued him for imitating nature.

A hybrid work: part dog’s ear,
<br>part radio. Everything useful is ugly.

Her cannibalistic fantasy involved
<br>the flesh of meat-purveyors.

The surrogate ate the frozen peas
<br>frozen. Heat makes us human.

Her degree was in media ministry.
<br>Her thesis: how to virtualize immortality.

The audience was moved by the love of
<br>the dwarf-tenor and the morbidly obese soprano.

The puppeteer spoke through a swizzle,
<br>“I shall be laughed at all over Osaka.”

A puppet with no action required
<br>of him is called a master artist.

The gesturing statue had come to life.
<br>The Jesus puppet was tied to his cross.

She gathered his limbs, beat her wings,
<br>and brought him back to life.

When he places his right hand on his left breast,
<br>we may safely assume that he is in love.
