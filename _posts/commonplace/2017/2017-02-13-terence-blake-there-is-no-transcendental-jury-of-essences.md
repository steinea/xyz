“The burden of proof is upon Badiou from the moment that another system exists that has 15 modes of veridiction.”

“My worry is over the reflexive elevation, perennisation and legitimation of a rather quirky selection of truth procedures to the status of the only possible configuration of the contemporary situation of truths.”

“Badiou falls into a form essentialism. For example, the matheme is not the same thing as the science of mathematics, but constitutes their pretended speculative essence. From a materialist point of view this can only correspond to the extraction from a heterogeneous assemblage of one tendency placed above all its other elements as their unitary hegemonic essence.”
