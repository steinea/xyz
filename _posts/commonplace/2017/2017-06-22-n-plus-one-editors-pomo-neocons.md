“Whether from complacency or ignorance, too many of us with left-wing prejudices believed that “advanced methods” were enough to change the world. The Standard proves that learning to think strategically about symbolic forms doesn’t necessitate any particular substantive politics.”

“Like plenty of the fare at the Standard, these writers demonstrate a facility with the language, methods, and moves of disciplines thought to have been the exclusive preserve of the academic left. This may reflect the developing consciousness of a right-wing poststructuralism and postmodernism. Or it may just be the shaping hand of intelligent editors who have learned from the enemies they affect to despise.”
