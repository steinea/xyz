“Latour’s well-known opposition to critique is a pretence”

“his de-concepted surface is “diplomatic””

“Latour is very critical of both naive realism and relativism, arguing in favour of a realist pluralism.”

“It is only by taking Latour’s de-concepted surface style at face value that OOO can pretend to absorb actor-network theory into its own veritably de-concepted body”

“Latour’s entire theoretical corpus contains a continuous critique of the sort of metaphysics that OOO represents.”

“Thus both the relativist reading and the ooo-realist reading are based on a concept-blind hermeneutics that is the very antithesis of Latour’s interpretative strategy.”
