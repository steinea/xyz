Picking out a few morsels, bits of sentence from the final session (26 March 2003) of Jacques Derrida’s The Beast and the Sovereign, I hope to illuminate the strangeness of ‘the fiction of the world’. At issue is the figure of fiction both in a conventional literary sense and in accordance with what he describes, in For What Tomorrow... (2001), as ‘the debt of all theoretical (but also all juridical, ethical and political) positing, to a performative power structured by fiction, by a figural invention’.

Referring to:

Jacques Derrida, in Jacques Derrida and Elisabeth Roudinesco, For What Tomorrow...A Dialogue, trans. Jeff Fort (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2004), 173. This work was first published in French in 2001.
