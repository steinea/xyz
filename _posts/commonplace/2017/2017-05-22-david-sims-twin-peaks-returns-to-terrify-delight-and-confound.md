“today, Lynch and Frost seem even less concerned about keeping audiences on board with a propulsive or linear narrative.”

“As such, it’s a challenge to summarize the actual plot of “Parts 1 & 2,” which aired Sunday night, the first two in an 18-hour series. These episodes scattered a lot of fascinating imagery, disconnected story ideas, and inter-dimensional nightmare antics in front of its audience; it’s up to viewers to try and put the pieces together, or (my preferred method) simply soak in every bizarre tableau with glee. It’s been more than 10 years since Lynch has come out with a major work (2006’s Inland Empire), and judging from what has aired so far, Twin Peaks (subtitled The Return) is a worthy new entry in his canon.”

“Twin Peaks remains the nightmare fuel it always has been.”

“In the intervening decades, Lynch, and thus Twin Peaks, has only gotten more abrasive.”
