*11th century*

*A free interpretation of the Chauraspanchasika*

Even now
<br>My thought is all of this gold-tinted king's daughter
<br>With garlands tissue and golden buds,
<br>Smoke tangles of her hair, and sleeping or waking
<br>Feet trembling in love, full of pale languor;
<br>My thought is clinging as to a lost learning
<br>Slipped down out of the minds of men,
<br>Labouring to bring her back into my soul.

Even now
<br>If I see in my soul the citron-breasted fair one
<br>Still gold-tinted, her face like our night stars,
<br>Drawing unto her; her body beaten about with flame,
<br>Wounded by the flaring spear of love,
<br>My first of all by reason of her fresh years,
<br>Then is my heart buried alive in snow.

Even now
<br>If my girl with lotus eyes came to me again
<br>Weary with the dear weight of young love,
<br>Again I would give her to these starved twins of arms
<br>And from her mouth drink down the heavy wine,
<br>As a reeling pirate bee in fluttered ease
<br>Steals up the honey from the nenuphar.

Even now
<br>I bring her back, ah, wearied out with love
<br>So that her slim feet could not bear her up;
<br>Curved falls of her hair down on her white cheeks;
<br>In the confusion of her coloured vests
<br>Speaking that guarded giving up, and her scented arms
<br>Lay like cool bindweed over against my neck.

Even now
<br>I bring her back to me in her quick shame,
<br>Hiding her bright face at the point of day;
<br>Making her grave eyes move in watered stars,
<br>For love's great sleeplessness wandering all night,
<br>Seeming to sail gently, as that pink bird,
<br>Down the water of love in a harvest of lotus.

Even now
<br>If I saw her lying all wide eyes
<br>And with collyrium the indent of her cheek
<br>Lengthened to the bright ear and her pale side
<br>So suffering the fever of my distance,
<br>Then would my love for her be ropes of flowers, and night
<br>A black-haired lover on the breasts of day.

Even now
<br>I see the heavy startled hair of this reed-flute player
<br>Who curved her poppy lips to love dances,
<br>Having a youth's face madding like the moon
<br>Lying at her full; limbs ever moving a little in love,
<br>Too slight, too delicate, tired with the small burden
<br>Of bearing love ever on white feet.

Even now
<br>She is present to me on her beds,
<br>Balmed with the exhalation of a flattering musk,
<br>Rich with the curly essence of santal;
<br>Girl with eyes dazing as the seeded-wine,
<br>Showing as a pair of gentle nut-hatches
<br>Kissing each other with their bills, each hidden
<br>By turns within a little grasping mouth.

Even now
<br>She swims back in the crowning hour of love
<br>All red with wine her lips have given to drink,
<br>Soft round the mouth with camphor and faint blue
<br>Tinted upon the lips, her slight body,
<br>Her great live eyes, the colourings of herself
<br>A clear perfection; sighs of musk outstealing
<br>And powdered wood spice heavy of Cashmir.

Even now
<br>I see her; fair face blond like gold
<br>Rich with small lights, and tinted shadows surprised
<br>Over and over all of her; with glittering eyes
<br>All bright for love but very love-weary,
<br>As it were the conjuring disk of the moon when Rahu ceases
<br>With his dark stumbling-block to hide her rays.

Even now
<br>She is art-magically present to my soul
<br>And that one word of strange heart's ease, good-bye,
<br>That in the night, in loth moving to go,
<br>And bending over to a golden mouth,
<br>I said softly to the turned away
<br>Tenderly tired hair of this king's daughter.

Even now
<br>My eyes that hurry to see no more are painting, painting
<br>Faces of my lost girl. O golden rings,
<br>That tap against cheeks of small magnolia leaves,
<br>O whitest so soft parchment where
<br>My poor divorced lips have written excellent
<br>Stanzas of kisses, and will write no more.

Even now
<br>Death sends me the flickering of powdery lids
<br>Over wild eyes and the pity of her slim body
<br>All broken up with the weariness of joy;
<br>The little red flowers of her breasts to be my comfort
<br>Moving above scarves, and for my sorrow
<br>Wet crimson lips that once I marked as mine.

Even now
<br>By a cool noise of waters in the spring
<br>The asoka with young flowers that feign her fingers
<br>And bud in red; and in the green vest pearls kissing
<br>As it were rose leaves in the gardens of God; the shining at night
<br>Of white cheeks in the dark; smiles from light thoughts within,
<br>And her walking as of a swan; these trouble me.

Even now
<br>The pleased intimacy of rough love
<br>Upon the patient glory of her form
<br>Racks me with memory; and her bright dress
<br>As it were yellow flame, which the white hand
<br>Shamefastly gathers in her rising haste,
<br>The slender grace of her departing feet.

Even now
<br>When all my heavy heart is broken up
<br>I seem to see my prison walls breaking
<br>And then a light, and in that light a girl
<br>Her fingers busied about her hair, her cool white arms
<br>Faint rosy at the elbows, raised in the sunlight,
<br>And temperate eyes that wander far away.

Even now
<br>I seem to see my prison walls come close,
<br>Built up of darkness, and against that darkness
<br>A girl no taller than my breast and very tired,
<br>Leaning upon the bed and smiling, feeding
<br>A little bird and lying slender as ash-trees,
<br>Sleepily aware as I told of the green
<br>Grapes and the small bright-coloured river flowers.

Even now
<br>I see her, as I used, in her white palace
<br>Under black torches throwing cool red light,
<br>Woven with many flowers and tearing the dark.
<br>I see her rising, showing all her face
<br>Defiant timidly, saying clearly;
<br>Now I shall go to sleep, good-night, my ladies.

Even now
<br>Though I am so far separate, a flight of birds
<br>Swinging from side to side over the valley trees,
<br>Passing my prison with their calling and crying,
<br>Bring me to see my girl. For very bird-like
<br>Is her song singing, and the state of a swan
<br>In her light walking, like the shaken wings
<br>Of a black eagle falls her nightly hair.

Even now
<br>I know my princess was happy. I see her stand
<br>Touching her breasts with all her flower-soft fingers,
<br>Looking askance at me with smiling eyes.
<br>There is a god that arms him with a flower
<br>And she was stricken deep. Her, oh die here.
<br>Kiss me and I shall be purer than quick rivers.

Even now
<br>They chatter her weakness through the two bazaars
<br>Who was so strong to love me. And small men
<br>That buy and sell for silver being slaves
<br>Crinkle the fat about their eyes; and yet
<br>No Prince of the Cities of the Sea has taken her,
<br>Leading to his grim bed. Little lonely one,
<br>You clung to me as a garment clings, my girl.

Even now
<br>Only one dawn shall rise for me. The stars
<br>Revolve to-morrow's night and I not heed.
<br>One brief cold watch beside an empty heart
<br>And that is all. This night she rests not well;
<br>Oh, sleep; for there is heaviness for all the world
<br>Except for the death-lighted heart of me.

Even now
<br>My sole concern the slipping of her vests,
<br>Her little breasts the life beyond this life.
<br>One night of disarray in her green hems,
<br>Her golden cloths, outweighs the order of the earth,
<br>Making of none effect the tides of the sea.
<br>I have seen her enter the temple meekly and there seem
<br>The flag of flowers that veils the very god.

Even now
<br>I mind the coming and talking of wise men from towers
<br>Where they had thought away their youth. And I, listening,
<br>Found not the salt of the whispers of my girl,
<br>Murmur of confused colours, as we lay near sleep;
<br>Little wise words and little witty words
<br>Wanton as water, honeyed with eagerness.

Even now
<br>I call to mind her weariness in the morning
<br>Close lying in my arms, and tiredly smiling
<br>At my disjointed prayer for her small sake.
<br>Now in my morning the weariness of death
<br>Sends me to sleep. Had I made coffins
<br>I might have lived singing to three score.

Even now
<br>The woodcutter and fisherman turn home,
<br>With on his axe the moon and in his dripping net
<br>Caught yellow moonlight. The purple flame of fire
<br>Calls them to love and sleep. From the hot town
<br>The maker of scant songs for bread wanders
<br>To lie under the clematis with his girl.
<br>The moon shines on her breasts, and I must die.

Even now
<br>I have a need to make up prayers, to speak
<br>My last consideration of the world
<br>To the great thirteen gods, to make my balance
<br>Ere the soul journeys on. I kneel and say:
<br>Father of Light. Leave we it burning still
<br>That I may look at you. Mother of the Stars,
<br>Give me your feet to kiss; I love you, dear.

Even now
<br>I seem to see the face of my lost girl
<br>With frightened eyes, like a wood wanderer,
<br>In travail with sorrowful waters, unwept tears
<br>Labouring to be born and fall; when white face turned
<br>And little ears caught at the far murmur,
<br>The pleased snarling of the tumult of dogs
<br>When I was buried away down the white road.

Even now
<br>When slow rose-yellow moons looked out at night
<br>To guard the sheaves of harvest and mark down
<br>The peach's fall, how calm she was and love worthy.
<br>Glass-coloured starlight falling as thin as dew
<br>Was wont to find us at the spirit's starving time
<br>Slow straying in the orchard paths with love.

Even now
<br>Love is a god and Rati the dark his bride;
<br>But once I found their child and she was fairer,
<br>That could so shine. And we were each to each
<br>Wonderful and a presence not yet felt
<br>In any dream. I knew the sunset earth
<br>But as a red gold ring to bear my emerald
<br>Within the little summer of my youth.

Even now
<br>I marvel at the bravery of love,
<br>She, whose two feet might be held in one hand
<br>And all her body on a shield of the guards,
<br>Lashed like a gold panther taken in a pit
<br>Tearfully valiant, when I too was taken'
<br>Bearding her black-beard father in his wrath,
<br>Striking the soldiers with white impotent hands.

Even now
<br>I mind that I loved cypress and roses, dear,
<br>The great blue mountains and the small grey hills,
<br>The sounding of the sea. Upon a day
<br>I saw strange eyes and hands like butterflies;
<br>For me at morning larks flew from the thyme
<br>And children came to bathe in little streams.

Even now
<br>Sleep left me all these nights for your white bed
<br>And I am sure you sistered lay with sleep
<br>After much weeping. Piteous little love,
<br>Death is in the garden, time runs down,
<br>The year that simple and unexalted ran till now
<br>Ferments in winy autumn, and I must die.

Even now
<br>I mind our going, full of bewilderment
<br>As who should walk from sleep into great light,
<br>Along the running of the winter river,
<br>A dying sun on the cool hurrying tide
<br>No more by green rushes delayed in dalliance,
<br>With a clear purpose in his flower-flecked length
<br>Informed, to reach Nirvana and the sea.

Even now
<br>I love long black eyes that caress like silk,
<br>Ever and ever sad and laughing eyes,
<br>Whose lids make such sweet shadow when they close
<br>It seems another beautiful look of hers.
<br>I love a fresh mouth, ah, a scented mouth,
<br>And curving hair, subtle as a smoke,
<br>And light fingers, and laughter of green gems.

Even now
<br>I mind asking: Where love and how love Rati's priestesses?
<br>You can tell me of their washings at moon-down
<br>And if that warm basin have silver borders.
<br>Is it so that when they comb their hair
<br>Their fingers, being purple-stained, show
<br>Like coral branches in the black sea of their hair?

Even now
<br>I remember that you made answer very softly,
<br>We being one soul, your hand on my hair,
<br>The burning memory rounding your near lips;
<br>I have seen the priestesses of Rati make love at moon-fall
<br>And then in a carpeted hall with a bright gold lamp
<br>Lie down carelessly anywhere to sleep.

Even now
<br>I have no surety that she is not Mahadevi
<br>Rose red of Siva, or Kapagata
<br>The wilful ripe Companion of the King,
<br>Or Krishna's own Lakshmi, the violet-haired.
<br>I am not certain but that dark Brahma
<br>In his high secret purposes
<br>Has sent my soft girl down to make the three worlds mad
<br>With capering about her scented feet.

Even now
<br>Call not the master painters from all the world,
<br>Their thin black boards, their rose and green and grey,
<br>Their ashes of lapis ultramarine, 
<br>Their earth of shadows the umber. Laughing at art
<br>Sunlight upon the body of my bride,
<br>For painting not nor any eyes for ever.
<br>Oh warm tears on the body of my bride.

Even now
<br>I mind when the red crowds were passed and it was raining
<br>How glad those two that shared the rain with me;
<br>For they talked happily with rich young voices
<br>And at the storm's increase, closer and with content,
<br>Each to the body of the other held
<br>As there were no more severance for ever.

Even now
<br>The stainless fair appearance of the moon
<br>Rolls her gold beauty over an autumn sky
<br>And the stiff anchorite forgets to pray;
<br>How much the sooner I, if her wild mouth
<br>Tasting of the taste of manna came to mine
<br>And kept my soul at balance above a kiss.

Even now
<br>Her mouth careless scented as with lotus dust
<br>Is water of love to the great heat of love,
<br>A tirtha very holy, a lover's lake
<br>Utterly sacred. Might I go down to it
<br>But one more time, then should I find a way
<br>To hold my lake for ever and ever more
<br>Sobbing out my life beside the waters.

Even now
<br>I mind that the time of the falling of blossoms started my dream
<br>Into a wild life, into my girl;
<br>Then was the essence of her beauty spilled
<br>Down on my days so that it fades not,
<br>Fails not, subtle and fresh, in perfuming
<br>That day, and the days, and this the latest day.

Even now
<br>She with young limbs as smooth as flower pollen,
<br>Whose swaying body is laved in the cool
<br>Waters of languor, this dear bright-coloured bird,
<br>Walks not, changes not, advances not
<br>Her weary station by the black lake
<br>Of Gone Forever, in whose fountain vase
<br>Balance the water-lilies of my thought.

Even now
<br>Spread we our nets beyond the farthest rims
<br>So surely that they take the feet of dawn
<br>Before you wake and after you are sleeping
<br>Catch up the visible and invisible stars
<br>And web the ports the strongest dreamer dreamed,
<br>Yet is it all one, Vidya, yet it is nothing.

Even now
<br>The night is full of silver straws of rain,
<br>And I will send my soul to see your body
<br>This last poor time. I stand beside our bed;
<br>Your shadowed head lies leaving a bright space
<br>Upon the pillow empty, your sorrowful arm
<br>Holds from your side and clasps not anything.
<br>There is no covering upon you.

Even now
<br>I think your feet seek mine to comfort them.
<br>There is some dream about you even now
<br>Which I'll not hear at waking. Weep not at dawn,
<br>Though day brings wearily your daily loss
<br>And all the light is hateful. Now is it time
<br>To bring my soul away.

Even now
<br>I mind that I went round with men and women,
<br>And underneath their brows, deep in their eyes,
<br>I saw their souls, which go slippng aside
<br>In swarms before the pleasure of my mind;
<br>The world was like a flight of birds, shadow or flame
<br>Which I saw pass above the engraven hills.
<br>Yet was there never one like to my woman.

Even now
<br>Death I take up as consolation.
<br>Nay, were I free as the condor with his wings
<br>Or old kings throned on violet ivory,
<br>Night would not come without beds of green floss
<br>And never a bed without my bright darling.
<br>Most fit that you strike now, black guards,
<br>And let the fountain out before the dawn.

Even now
<br>I know that I have savoured the hot taste of life
<br>Lifting green cups and gold at the great feast.
<br>Just for a small and a forgotten time
<br>I have had full in my eyes from off my girl
<br>The whitest pouring of eternal light.
<br>The heavy knife. As to a gala day.
