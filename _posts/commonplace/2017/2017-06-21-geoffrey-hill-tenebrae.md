*He was so tired that he was scarcely able to hear a note of the songs: he felt imprisoned in a cold region where his brain was numb and his spirit was isolated.*


1 

Requite this angel whose 
<br>flushed and thirsting face  
<br>stoops to the sacrifice 
<br>out of which it arose. 
<br>This is the lord Eros 
<br>of grief who pities 
<br>no one; it is 
<br>Lazarus with his sores. 


2 

And you, who with your soft but searching voice 
<br>drew me out of the sleep where I was lost, 
<br>who held me near your heart that I might rest 
<br>confiding in the darkness of your choice: 
<br>possessed by you I chose to have no choice, 
<br>fulfilled in you I sought no further quest. 
<br>You keep me, now, in dread that quenches trust, 
<br>in desolation where my sins rejoice. 
<br>As I am passionate so you with pain 
<br>turn my desire; as you seem passionless 
<br>so I recoil from all that I would gain, 
<br>wounding myself upon forgetfulness, 
<br>false ecstasies, which you in truth sustain 
<br>as you sustain each item of your cross.

Veni Redemptor, but not in our time. 
<br>Christus Resurgens, quite out of this world. 
<br>‘Ave’ we cry; the echoes are returned. 
<br>Amor Carnalis is our dwelling-place. 


4 

O light of light, supreme delight; 
<br>grace on our lips to our disgrace. 
<br>Time roosts on all such golden wrists; 
<br>our leanness is our luxury. 
<br>Our love is what we love to have; 
<br>our faith is in our festivals. 


5 

Stupefying images of grief-in-dream, 
<br>succubae to my natural grief of heart, 
<br>cling to me, then; you who will not desert 
<br>your love nor lose him in some blank of time. 
<br>You come with all the licence of her name 
<br>to tell me you are mine. But you are not 
<br>and she is not. Can my own breath be hurt 
<br>by breathless shadows groaning in their game? 
<br>It can. The best societies of hell 
<br>acknowledge this, aroused by what they know: 
<br>consummate rage recaptured there in full 
<br>as faithfulness demands it, blow for blow, 
<br>and rectitude that mimics its own fall 
<br>reeling with sensual abstinence and woe.

This is the ash-pit of the lily-fire, 
<br>this is the questioning at the long tables, 
<br>this is true marriage of the self-in-self, 
<br>this is a raging solitude of desire, 
<br>this is the chorus of obscene consent, 
<br>this is a single voice of purest praise. 

 
7 

He wounds with ecstasy. All 
<br>the wounds are his own. 
<br>He wears the martyr’s crown. 
<br>He is the Lord of Misrule. 
<br>He is the Master of the Leaping Figures, 
<br>the motley factions. 
<br>Revelling in auguries 
<br>he is the Weeper of the Valedictions. 

 
8 

Music survives, composing her own sphere, 
<br>Angel of Tones, Medusa, Queen of the Air, 
<br>and when we would accost her with real cries 
<br>silver on silver thrills itself to ice.
