I had a dream, which was not all a dream. 
<br>The bright sun was extinguish'd, and the stars 
<br>Did wander darkling in the eternal space, 
<br>Rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth 
<br>Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air; 
<br>Morn came and wentand came, and brought no day, 
<br>And men forgot their passions in the dread 
<br>Of this their desolation; and all hearts 
<br>Were chill'd into a selfish prayer for light: 
<br>And they did live by watchfiresand the thrones, 
<br>The palaces of crowned kingsthe huts, 
<br>The habitations of all things which dwell, 
<br>Were burnt for beacons; cities were consum'd, 
<br>And men were gather'd round their blazing homes 
<br>To look once more into each other's face; 
<br>Happy were those who dwelt within the eye 
<br>Of the volcanos, and their mountain-torch: 
<br>A fearful hope was all the world contain'd; 
<br>Forests were set on firebut hour by hour 
<br>They fell and fadedand the crackling trunks 
<br>Extinguish'd with a crashand all was black. 
<br>The brows of men by the despairing light 
<br>Wore an unearthly aspect, as by fits 
<br>The flashes fell upon them; some lay down 
<br>And hid their eyes and wept; and some did rest 
<br>Their chins upon their clenched hands, and smil'd; 
<br>And others hurried to and fro, and fed 
<br>Their funeral piles with fuel, and look'd up 
<br>With mad disquietude on the dull sky, 
<br>The pall of a past world; and then again 
<br>With curses cast them down upon the dust, 
<br>And gnash'd their teeth and howl'd: the wild birds shriek'd 
<br>And, terrified, did flutter on the ground, 
<br>And flap their useless wings; the wildest brutes 
<br>Came tame and tremulous; and vipers crawl'd 
<br>And twin'd themselves among the multitude, 
<br>Hissing, but stinglessthey were slain for food. 
<br>And War, which for a moment was no more, 
<br>Did glut himself again: a meal was bought 
<br>With blood, and each sate sullenly apart 
<br>Gorging himself in gloom: no love was left; 
<br>All earth was but one thoughtand that was death 
<br>Immediate and inglorious; and the pang 
<br>Of famine fed upon all entrailsmen 
<br>Died, and their bones were tombless as their flesh; 
<br>The meagre by the meagre were devour'd, 
<br>Even dogs assail'd their masters, all save one, 
<br>And he was faithful to a corse, and kept 
<br>The birds and beasts and famish'd men at bay, 
<br>Till hunger clung them, or the dropping dead 
<br>Lur'd their lank jaws; himself sought out no food, 
<br>But with a piteous and perpetual moan, 
<br>And a quick desolate cry, licking the hand 
<br>Which answer'd not with a caresshe died. 
<br>The crowd was famish'd by degrees; but two 
<br>Of an enormous city did survive, 
<br>And they were enemies: they met beside 
<br>The dying embers of an altar-place 
<br>Where had been heap'd a mass of holy things 
<br>For an unholy usage; they rak'd up, 
<br>And shivering scrap'd with their cold skeleton hands 
<br>The feeble ashes, and their feeble breath 
<br>Blew for a little life, and made a flame 
<br>Which was a mockery; then they lifted up 
<br>Their eyes as it grew lighter, and beheld 
<br>Each other's aspectssaw, and shriek'd, and died 
<br>Even of their mutual hideousness they died, 
<br>Unknowing who he was upon whose brow 
<br>Famine had written Fiend. The world was void, 
<br>The populous and the powerful was a lump, 
<br>Seasonless, herbless, treeless, manless, lifeless 
<br>A lump of deatha chaos of hard clay. 
<br>The rivers, lakes and ocean all stood still, 
<br>And nothing stirr'd within their silent depths; 
<br>Ships sailorless lay rotting on the sea, 
<br>And their masts fell down piecemeal: as they dropp'd 
<br>They slept on the abyss without a surge 
<br>The waves were dead; the tides were in their grave, 
<br>The moon, their mistress, had expir'd before; 
<br>The winds were wither'd in the stagnant air, 
<br>And the clouds perish'd; Darkness had no need 
<br>Of aid from them. She was the Universe.
