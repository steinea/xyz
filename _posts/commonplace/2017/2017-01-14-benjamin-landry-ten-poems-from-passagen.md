“[… A] cradle rocking back and forth between modernity and antiquity […]”
<br>—The Arcades Project

Pan speaking panisms at the church
<br> of Christ, Pantokrater, in place
<br> of the usual docent, breast of sportscoat
<br> bulging with his pipes.  Pan, with high,
<br> horned forehead, gently receding locks,
<br> takes one back to the river, the skinbag,
<br> the basket.  Leaves of aspens overhanging
<br> wave yes, no, sayonara.  It’s Pan speaking,
<br> now.  He points out frescoes, polite
<br> hooves shattered by mosaics.  And before
<br> that, the womb, and before that,
<br> the shiver that made mothering possible.

<br> 

“[… S]uddenly a roof, a gleam of sunlight reflected from a stone, the smell of a road would make me stop still, to enjoy the special pleasure that each of them gave me, and also because they appeared to be concealing, beneath what my eyes could see, something which they invited me to approach and take from them, but which, despite all my efforts, I never managed to discover.”
<br>—The Arcades Project (Proust)

I admit it, as one ill with possession,
<br> eyes two molten pockets.  Under
<br> my long coat is a tiger pit, and yet,
<br> I’m in the market for shovels,
<br> depth, bamboo.  It goes without
<br> saying, tigers.  And a bomb-riding
<br> mascot to indicate when we’ve arrived
<br> at the banks of the Bosporus,
<br> exhausted east or west. 

This long coat does not smell like fear,
<br> exactly, more like settling up, sweat
<br> and sweet grief.  I’ve never seen a tiger
<br> in the flesh, says the man being stalked
<br> by one in the jungle.  What, praytell,
<br> does he imagine a tiger will get him?
<br> Exotic carpet sex?  A complete set?
<br> Or home?  Home is the sort 
<br> of thing that needs a tourniquet,

all the mother-smelling gowns
<br> and father-smelling bath robes 
<br> clawed to pink shreds.  Will there 
<br> be enough to stop the bleeding? 
<br> If not, try elevation, above the heart, 
<br> but the breeze smells like birthdays
<br> here, like metallic kisses, like bats
<br> raising their latex young in chirping
<br> darkness set like a trap for tigers.

<br> 

“[… T]he arcade, too, is a windowless house. The windows that look down on it are like loges from which one gazes into its interior, but one cannot see out these windows to anything outside. (What is true has no windows; nowhere does the true look out on the universe.)”
<br> —The Arcades Project

You’re stop-moth, a shocking,
<br> implausible scrawl, in love with
<br> your own neon.  In sex with
<br> your muzzle mute swan.

You wish there were a way
<br> to be less mortal, less tragic,
<br> but specters are stay-at-home,
<br> lily-watering types.  Lakes

have a way of containing
<br> your umbrage.  Overpasses bear
<br> with your rush hour.  Pinpricks
<br> look in on your sleep as though

they were adults and you
<br> their child whom they might
<br> possibly protect from all that
<br> waits to befall you.

<br> 

“[… E]ight days later the crinoline had doubled in size.”
<br> —The Arcades Project (Du Camp)

and our sense of being estranged
<br> from the infinite had halved.

Layer, layer.  There must be
<br> something at center.

Liar.  No one is coming back
<br> with cigarettes, with milk
<br> in their arms like a permanent payload.

We don’t have time to wait
<br> for each layer to wither, fall away.

You said we have nothing but—
<br> Whip-Poor-Will.  Sounds nothing

like.  Maybe a kettle.  Or a child
<br> blowing across the mouth
<br> of his father’s beer bottle.

Maybe this is why I find peonies
<br> disturbing.  White after white.

I’m supposed to remain wanting,
<br> Poor-Will.  And it’s true.

“It is curious that every time we buy a house, a boulevard passes through it.”
<br> —The Arcades Project (Dubech and d’Espezel)

plainfuls of Canadian arctic wind

a truck with thousands of laying hens in crates

I turn to my daughter in her car seat
<br> how do you begin to explain something like that

all the houses of the village
<br> illuminated as though from a single
<br> interior light

the ocean longing of landlocked salmon
<br> practicing their lines

old-growth forests dying to be left alone
 
<br> 

“And in no other way can one deal with the arcades—structures in which we relive, as in a dream, the life of our parents and grandparents, as the embryo in the womb relives the life of animals.”
<br> —The Arcades Project

two black stallions as bookends their hooves dipped in gold and through the thick polycarbonate sheets of the Mystic Aquarium pale-bodied beluga whales see how long they can hold their breaths on the television special glaciers are calving solid ground circulating air a series of jolts as when the dry barbed tongue of the cat first startles so many of them now we are running out of songbirds and the bushes wail with the distinct frequency of abandonment registering as a shadow on a sonogram

“The relation of the Jugendstil interior to its predecessors comes down to the fact that the bourgeois conceals his alibi in history with a still more remote alibi in natural history […]”
<br> —The Arcades Project

i.

In the Royal Botanic Garden,
<br> a rare cycad grows in a wrought
<br> iron bell jar.  Fruit bats hang
<br> above, leather laments
<br> for the bygone Paleozoic.

ii.

In the elevator of Tacoma’s
<br> Park Tower, a disgruntled tenant
<br> scorches the green wall carpet
<br> then carves out leaf-shaped patches
<br> with a utility knife.

“What I have in mind here will become sufficiently clear if I say that I find in Balzac no interior life of any kind, but rather a devouring and wholly external curiosity which takes the form of movement without passing through thought.”
<br> —The Arcades Project (Alain)

so maybe the pleasure specific
<br> but the contraction extension
<br> are general   to obviate the boundary
<br> between body and body which
<br> more than one poet has warned
<br> me is a dirty word   I say jump
<br> in the ocean   where do you end
<br> where does the water begin   if you
<br> think you can say you have my pity
 
<br> 

“[… T]he briefcase with interior lighting […]”
<br> —The Arcades Project

the whale with Jonah reflux

neutrinos let loose, a signal array
<br> of recessed volcanoes

Iditerod dogsled heaped with extra large
<br> bags of Purina Dog Chow

hecatomb with rave glowsticks

The real question is what is
<br> on final approach, what stunner
<br> has come home to roost?

mares’ tails swish over beige tracts of Roswell

Will you be like one of those extras
<br> in movies who softly exclaim then hurry inside,
<br> or come out, hand on hip, for a better look?
 
<br> 

“The Ministry of the Interior refuses to issue its stamp to Les Paradis Artificiels.”
<br> —The Arcades Project

Actual Paradise.  Heavens of flesh and blood
<br> stalking supply closets, interrupting the tele-
<br> conference to beg, Come over and say that to my face.

Paradise of clicking heels in the parking garage,
<br> a jack dropping firs exactly in their shadows.
<br> Edens of fading bouquets, downtime, blue-

bottle flies touching everything, everything.
