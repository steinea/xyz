The extraordinary patience of things! 
<br>This beautiful place defaced with a crop of suburban houses—
<br>How beautiful when we first beheld it,
<br>Unbroken field of poppy and lupin walled with clean cliffs;
<br>No intrusion but two or three horses pasturing,
<br>Or a few milch cows rubbing their flanks on the outcrop rockheads—
<br>Now the spoiler has come: does it care?
<br>Not faintly. It has all time. It knows the people are a tide
<br>That swells and in time will ebb, and all
<br>Their works dissolve. Meanwhile the image of the pristine beauty
<br>Lives in the very grain of the granite,
<br>Safe as the endless ocean that climbs our cliff.—As for us:
<br>We must uncenter our minds from ourselves;
<br>We must unhumanize our views a little, and become confident
<br>As the rock and ocean that we were made from.
