“Critique of pure laughter.”

“Laughter plays madly through the body, as though suddenly accessing another layer of reality. The shock of the abstract.”

“A pure line is embodied in the spatiotemporal dynamisms of the laugher”

“Laughter shakes loose the world, discovering something which doesn’t belong; that which the world hides from itself.”

“The laugh opens onto virtual events: pure space and time; modalities in the flesh.”

“Cloudbank.”

“Truth is “of an hour”, a matter of bodily intensities (Zourabichvilli).”

“it seems clear that virtualization will disrupt the store into the cosmos, expanding the dynamic field of the buyable onto our entire living and built environment.”

“The store can perhaps be understood as a machine for logistical war.”

“Virilio is a profound thinker of the materialization, the “concretion” of higher-order functions (celerities; trajectories) into first-order realities.”

“The store expresses a new relation to time — an indefinite warehousing.”

“With the shop, and certainly with the retail store, we find a human terminal for the integrated world-machinery of capitalism: the shop extracts traits and features from the deformalized matter of production.”

“It links flows of goods and of people into an artificial time, rendering-down to human scale the monstrous inhuman depth of complexity inherent in productive capability.”

“What counts within the store is the pertinence of singularities, indicating vortices and higher-order movements.”

“The store modulates in careful response to the unpredictable outside, to the flow of humanity in-person which streams through the spaces every day.”

“Perhaps cognition itself emerges with the enclosure and enumeration of herds, flocks and swarms — the distinction (counting and numbering) of people and animals.”

“Ethonomics.”

“The store is a war-machine captured by the market, an abstract machine redesigning itself experimentally; and humanity in the process.”
