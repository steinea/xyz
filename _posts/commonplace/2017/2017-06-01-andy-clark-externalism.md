"Externalism is a group of positions in the philosophy of mind which argues that the conscious mind is not only the result of what is going on inside the nervous system (or the brain), but also what occurs or exists outside the subject. It is contrasted with internalism which holds that the mind emerges from neural activity alone. Externalism is a belief that the mind is not just the brain or functions of the brain. Externalists include Andy Clark, David Chalmers, Alva Noe, and Riccardo Manzotti. Proto-externalists include Alfred North Whitehead, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, John Dewey, and Gregory Bateson."
