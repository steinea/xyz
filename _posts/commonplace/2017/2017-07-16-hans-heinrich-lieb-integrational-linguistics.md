"Integrational Linguistics is a general approach to linguistics that has been developed by the German linguist Hans-Heinrich Lieb and others since the late 1960s. The term &quot;Integrational Linguistics&quot; as a name for this approach has been used in publications since 1977 and antedates the use of the same term for integrationism, an unrelated approach developed by Roy Harris. Integrational linguistics is non-generative and non-transformational; it assumes neither deep-structures nor transformational relations. Rather, it conceives linguistic entities as interrelated, multidimensional objects, which are typically modelled as set-theoretic constructs."
