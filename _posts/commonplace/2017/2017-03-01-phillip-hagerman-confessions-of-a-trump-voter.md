“All the leaders in my county are registered Democrats. But almost all of us voted for the Republican Donald Trump because we don’t have much more to fear.”

“The Democratic Party has long prided itself for fighting for needs of the working men and women over the interests of the wealthy, but the message has gone flat. While so many progressives have been drunk with identity politics and trying to make every little educated interest group feel stroked and coddled, hardworking people struggling to put food on the table have lost faith in that old Democratic brand.”

“It’s offensive to tell a laid-off person who couldn’t go to college that their economic struggles aren’t as much of a concern as using the right pronoun.”

“And it’s almost impossible to conceive how your white skin is a basis of privilege when you’re surrounded by addiction, crime, and poverty.”

“Politicians have failed us, and it can’t get much worse, so why not give a successful businessman a chance to run things differently?”

“It’s no secret that Obama’s vow to “bankrupt” coal power plants, along with Hillary’s remarks that she’d “put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business,” struck fear in the hearts of those whose economy is dependent upon this industry.”

“West Virginians heard Trump promising to put coal miners back to work; they heard Hillary promising to put coal miners out of business.”

“For years, Democrats have been the voice for the working class of the United States, but while the most vocal Democrats were playing identity politics, Trump emerged as the voice of the working class.”

“West Virginians and most rural Americans just want a little opportunity, and that’s a rare commodity here, even if it’s what all citizens want in the end.”
