"Integrationism (also known as integrational linguistics) is an approach in the theory of communication that emphasizes innovative participation by communicators within contexts and rejects rule-based models of language. It was developed by a group of linguists at the University of Oxford during the 1980s, notably Roy Harris. Integrationism views language as not an internal psychological concern, but as linked to experience, context, and time. Integrationism rejects language as a fixed code. Language is, rather, a resource to conduct action with (echoing Austin, Searle, Gumperz, Sacks, Schegloff, Goodwin, Goffman, etc.)"
