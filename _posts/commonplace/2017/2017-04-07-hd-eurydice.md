I

So you have swept me back,
<br>I who could have walked with the live souls
<br>above the earth,
<br>I who could have slept among the live flowers
<br>at last;

so for your arrogance
<br>and your ruthlessness
<br>I am swept back
<br>where dead lichens drip
<br>dead cinders upon moss of ash;

so for your arrogance
<br>I am broken at last,
<br>I who had lived unconscious,
<br>who was almost forgot;

if you had let me wait
<br>I had grown from listlessness
<br>into peace,
<br>if you had let me rest with the dead,
<br>I had forgot you
<br>and the past.

<br>

II

Here only flame upon flame
<br>and black among the red sparks,
<br>streaks of black and light
<br>grown colourless;

why did you turn back,
<br>that hell should be reinhabited
<br>of myself thus
<br>swept into nothingness?

why did you glance back?
<br>why did you hesitate for that moment?
<br>why did you bend your face
<br>caught with the flame of the upper earth,
<br>above my face?

what was it that crossed my face
<br>with the light from yours
<br>and your glance?
<br>what was it you saw in my face?
<br>the light of your own face,
<br>the fire of your own presence?

What had my face to offer
<br>but reflex of the earth,
<br>hyacinth colour
<br>caught from the raw fissure in the rock
<br>where the light struck,
<br>and the colour of azure crocuses
<br>and the bright surface of gold crocuses
<br>and of the wind-flower,
<br>swift in its veins as lightning
<br>and as white.

<br>

III

Saffron from the fringe of the earth,
<br>wild saffron that has bent
<br>over the sharp edge of earth,
<br>all the flowers that cut through the earth,
<br>all, all the flowers are lost;

everything is lost,
<br>everything is crossed with black,
<br>black upon black
<br>and worse than black,
<br>this colourless light.

<br>

IV

Fringe upon fringe
<br>of blue crocuses,
<br>crocuses, walled against blue of themselves,
<br>blue of that upper earth,
<br>blue of the depth upon depth of flowers,
<br>lost;

flowers,
<br>if I could have taken once my breath of them,
<br>enough of them,
<br>more than earth,
<br>even than of the upper earth,
<br>had passed with me
<br>beneath the earth;

if I could have caught up from the earth,
<br>the whole of the flowers of the earth,
<br>if once I could have breathed into myself
<br>the very golden crocuses
<br>and the red,
<br>and the very golden hearts of the first saffron,
<br>the whole of the golden mass,
<br>the whole of the great fragrance,
<br>I could have dared the loss.

<br>

V

So for your arrogance
<br>and your ruthlessness
<br>I have lost the earth   
<br>and the flowers of the earth,
<br>and the live souls above the earth,
<br>and you who passed across the light
<br>and reached
<br>ruthless;

you who have your own light,
<br>who are to yourself a presence,
<br>who need no presence;

yet for all your arrogance
<br>and your glance,
<br>I tell you this:

such loss is no loss,
<br>such terror, such coils and strands and pitfalls
<br>of blackness,
<br>such terror
<br>is no loss;

hell is no worse than your earth
<br>above the earth,
<br>hell is no worse,
<br>no, nor your flowers
<br>nor your veins of light
<br>nor your presence,
<br>a loss;

my hell is no worse than yours
<br>though you pass among the flowers and speak
<br>with the spirits above earth.

<br>

VI

Against the black
<br>I have more fervour
<br>than you in all the splendour of that place,
<br>against the blackness
<br>and the stark grey
<br>I have more light;

and the flowers,
<br>if I should tell you,
<br>you would turn from your own fit paths
<br>toward hell,
<br>turn again and glance back
<br>and I would sink into a place
<br>even more terrible than this.

<br>

VII

At least I have the flowers of myself,
<br>and my thoughts, no god
<br>can take that;
<br>I have the fervour of myself for a presence
<br>and my own spirit for light;

and my spirit with its loss
<br>knows this;
<br>though small against the black,
<br>small against the formless rocks,
<br>hell must break before I am lost;

before I am lost,
<br>hell must open like a red rose
<br>for the dead to pass.
