> @travisclau: Thank you for holding space with me. It was such an affirmation of what collectives of care and thinking can do.

@travisclau It was a truly freeing space to be in. Academia and critique exacts so much from us, but both your ideas and your practice showed how it could be otherwise. Gave me hope that we can do this sort of work differently than how it's been done for so long.
