Concluding my reading of Amanda Phillips' Gamer Trouble for the @noescapevg book club, "The Idea of the Gamer, 5: Identity and Agonism" is up now: <https://steinea.github.io/notes/2021/07/26/idea-of-gamer-5>. Thoughts on videogames, politics, and justice, working through chapter five and the conclusion to the book.
