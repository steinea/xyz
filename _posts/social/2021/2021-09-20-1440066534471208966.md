> @cassettewitch: Poetry and game friends: I'm looking for game designers/makers who are blending poetry and games, or poets who are playing with interactive/playful arts to create their work. Any leads, thoughts, suggestions?

@cassettewitch I completed a rather enormous research project on this subject this summer, looking at lyric games in the ttrpg space in connection with their precedents in theatre, poetry, music, and moreâ€”lots of resources in the bibliography
