You can now read my third entry for the @noescapevg book club, "The Idea of the Gamer, 3: Making Faces," right here: <https://steinea.github.io/notes/2021/05/30/idea-of-gamer-3>. This time, I reread Merleau-Ponty and Levinas on the face before turning to Phillips for a politics that goes beyond them.
