"The most dangerous and vile plague in The Last of Us is the infection-derived justification that humanity is entitled to brutality" @cianmaher0

"The cordyceps mutation is not the only infection festering in The Last of Us Part II, nor is the violence directly begotten from it. The most dangerous and vile plague in The Last of Us is the infection-derived justification that humanity is entitled to brutality, regardless of whether or not it is imposed on a mindless Clicker or an unfortunate nomad who happens to forage the last tin of beans from the suburban condo youâ€™re raiding."
