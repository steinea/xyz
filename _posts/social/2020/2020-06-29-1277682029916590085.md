@heartimecia I haven't known how to express everything I feel about this game. I started replaying it almost immediately, and I've just been reading and thinking and reading for days now. It wasn't until I read your piece that my thoughts coalesced. So thank you again!

> It’s a story about — among many things — a young woman who screams and breaks and destroys, who is fucked up and has to deal with the painful consequences of ruining things and lives, and having her own ruined in turn. It’s a story about powerless, ruined people who think they can fix themselves by ruining each other. There are no villains, but there are also no heroes, and The Last of Us Part II is intelligent enough to not pretend it can decide who fits in which category.
