There is too much I want to quote from this article, so here's just the first, and then you should go read the rest right here:

"For a game ostensibly about hate, The Last of Us Part II revolves around the complexities of love. It shows love at its most positive, between two people whose love is rarely normalized in media; as the driving force behind a powerful, overwhelming, all-consuming quest of anger, murder and retribution; as a means of defining identity and community, where we belong and where we are dehumanized. It conveys how love---in its equal potential to be merciful and violent---is intrinsically tied with survival."
