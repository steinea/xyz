"Perhaps if Part II offered a different kind of vision of what lies beyond civilization’s veil ... things might have turned out different"

"Perhaps if Part II offered a different kind of vision of what lies beyond civilization’s veil, one that didn’t see cities as charnel houses, beyond redemption, with or without infection, didn’t see suburbs and farms as precarious castles, meant to be protected by militarized force, didn’t see people of color as fodder or scaffolding for the stories of the largely white protagonists, things might have turned out different. A story of two women finding love in one another, a story of children learning how to evolve past the mistakes of their fathers: these stories and others should still be allowed to happen in ways that don’t reify the conservative individualism of Part II’s ideology. We still want Ellie and Dina to find their own version of happiness, of safety and security. But only if the rest of us get to have it too."
