@carolynmichelle Could there be a Left Behind or Lost Legacy-style denouement that emphasized these "other ways"? Could a Part III shift emphasis from hate (which we've been told was a lie) to love? Snowball fights, the scrapped clicker game, dancing in the kitchenâ€”this is what I want more of.

> But we know that things can be different. The Last of Us: Left Behind showed us that games like this can use their mechanics in other ways. That this kind of gameplay can be used as a way to explore the development of a relationship, as well as the murder of one person by another. And, of course, there are so many other kinds of gameplay that could be utilized.
