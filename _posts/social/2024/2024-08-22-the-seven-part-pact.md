Retweet @jdragsky: "i've released a new draft of THE SEVEN PART PACT, my insane wizard game that i've been working on for the past year+, on the possum creek patreon! you should go check it out if you're interested in wizards, crunchy mechanics, or patriarchal power structures

i can't express the amount of work, care and passion i've put into this game in the past year. i hope you check it out, support PCG, and tell me your thoughts
