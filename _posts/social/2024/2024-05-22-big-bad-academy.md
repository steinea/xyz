Repost @friede: "My dream for @bigbadcon.bsky.social was a wee “academic track” of researchers & makers together in the model of #GenerationAnalog, w/ funding for early career researchers.

Sean & Ash proposed we call it Big Bad Academy & make it a stretch goal — now live, in collab w/ @guyintheblackhat.bsky.social.
