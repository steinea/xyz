Repost @diyanddragons: "Shortly before TTRPG designer Jennell Jaquays died, OSR blogger Justin Alexander, who once named Jennell's dungeon drawing techniques after her, started trying to erase her legacy, and rename that style after himself.

I reject Justin's bad faith arguments for this, and celebrate Jaquaysian design.
