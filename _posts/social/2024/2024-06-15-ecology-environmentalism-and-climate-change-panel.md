It was a pleasure to present on the Ecology, Environmentalism, and Climate Change panel today at the @cgsaacej.bsky.social annual conference. I'll have my paper, "Dreams of Extraction: The Techno-Ecological Imaginary of Bethesda Game Studios' Starfield," up on on Zenodo soon.

As promised, my @cgsaacej.bsky.social paper "Dreams of Extraction" is now available open access. Using the critical aesthetics of Ranci√®re, Bourriaud, Parikka, and Graeber, this paper close reads Starfield's story to articulate its "techno-ecological imaginary."
