Ill Will has a new series, Worlds Apart, on #cosmology, #ecology, #sciencefiction, and #anticapitalist futures. To begin the series, they have excerpted the final chapter of Thomas Nail's Theory of the Earth, "Kinocene Ethics." This was an incredible read <https://illwill.com/kinocene-ethics>

"Nail invites us to imagine a reciprocal transformation of #philosophy and #cosmology: on the one hand, philosophy appears at once as a material and cosmic activity, one among many profligate techniques of kinetic expenditure; at the same time, the cosmos itself becomes, in a deeper sense, philosophical â€” that is, 'capable of philosophy.'"

I took too many notes to post them all here, but to entice readers to go see for themselves: Nail advocates for a more-than-human "metabolic #communism," on the basis that humans "are the #cosmos continued by other experimental means to increase the expenditure of the planet and the cosmos, but not alone."
