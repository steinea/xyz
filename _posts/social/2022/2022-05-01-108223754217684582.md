I recently replayed Night in the Woods, and the experience secured it as one of my all time favourite #games. A marvelous blend of the #material, the #weird, the #gothic, and the #cosmic.

@steinea Thanks for sharing this eric. I first heard about this game through a great video essay: https://yewtu.be/watch?v=X_Z4Jd0AtfI

Seems like a beautiful, thought provoking game â€” I'll have to check it out!

@cj Thanks for the link! I've watched quite a bit of Jacob Geller, but somehow never watched this one. And very much so beautiful and thought provoking, it's really quite a wonderful game. Highly recommend!
