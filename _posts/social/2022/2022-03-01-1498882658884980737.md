> @jesseross: 😍 Yay! What a great recap, and I'm so impressed at your ability to manage 12(!) players!

@jesseross So much credit to my students! I've been really impressed with how open, creative, and collaborative they are. Many of them had never played a ttrpg before this semester, but everyone has been engaged and enthusiastic and just excited to make drama together. So much fun.
