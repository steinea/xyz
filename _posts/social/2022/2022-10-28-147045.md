I've been on Cohost for a few months now, but haven't really known what to say here. I've just been lurking, enjoying the space, checking in once or twice a day to see if there's been anything new chosted. It's nice. With the exodus from Twitter, I figured I should at least put up a hello so folks know what's what.

So: hi! [We're here](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Jiub). I do all things games: [development](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steinea/), [design](https://vagrantludology.itch.io/), and [scholarship](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4131-2695). You can also find me [@/steinea](https://twitter.com/steinea) on Twitter and [@/steinea](https://assemblag.es/@steinea) on the [assemblag.es](https://assemblag.es/) Mastodon instance. I also have a site currently at steinea.github.io, which I'm working on migrating to a self-hosted server on a Raspberry Pi 4. I maintain a [research blog](https://steinea.github.io/notes/) there that can be subscribed to via RSS, and keep an infrequently updated [journal](https://steinea.github.io/journal/) that is also mirrored at [The Neon Kiosk](https://kiosk.nightfall.city/).

Recent work includes reviews of Cameron Kunzelman's [The World Is Born From Zero](https://ancillaryreviewofbooks.org/2022/09/21/mechanics-of-speculation-review-of-cameron-kunzelmans-the-world-is-born-from-zero/) and Tom Tyler's [Game: Animals, Video Games, and Humanity](https://ancillaryreviewofbooks.org/2022/08/29/being-meat-review-of-tom-tylers-game-animals-video-games-and-humanity/), both for the Ancillary Review of Books. Over the summer, I presented two research papers, ["Play to Lose"](https://zenodo.org/record/6932651) on facilitating Trophy Dark for an undergraduate game design course, and ["Production and Pedagogy"](https://zenodo.org/record/7036777) on the challenges and opportunities of teaching game development in a university game development program. Last year, I co-hosted (ha!) a really cool game jam, the [Applied Hope Solarpunk & Utopias Jam](https://itch.io/jam/applied-hope). I wrote a [big thread](https://twitter.com/steinea/status/1390772196209926145) covering the event, and the jam was featured on episode two of the [Serious Play](https://anchor.fm/serious-play/episodes/Episode-2-Jo-Lindsay-Walton-e1dj2qs) podcast.

So that's a bit about me. I'm awake. :host-joy:
