Reading Nail reminded me of the Strelka's Institute's fascinating project, Backcasting Kardashev One, an effort in rethinking #energy, #civilization, and #planetarity. <https://strelkamag.com/en/article/backcasting-kardashev-one>

The method of "backcasting" they deploy is a speculative effort akin to #sciencefiction, but with the express intent of linking their fictions back to the present so that we might go about the work of #planning. The different scenarios can be seen here: <https://www.backcasting-kardashev.one/>.
