"#history is better understood not as a determinate period of time or linear course of development, but a fundamental human capacity to #experiment with how to live"

From the latest in Ill Will's series Worlds Apart.

@steinea ooh this looks great!

I'm in the middle of reading _The Dawn of Everything_ right now so I'm curious about how this piece approaches the book â€” especially interested in the Benjamin connection.


Reply to @cj:

@cj Yeah I read this having not yet read The Dawn of Everything, but some prior Graeber,  and I thought it was a productive meeting of the two. This whole series from Ill Will has been good.
