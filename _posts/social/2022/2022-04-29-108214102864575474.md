Hello world!

A bit about me: I work in game development in Vancouver, where I also teach game design and development, interactive storytelling, and video game aesthetics.

I wrote my master's thesis on literature and the philosophy of technology, and you can find my ongoing thoughts on these and related topics at <https://steinea.github.io/notes>.

I link my other work here too, which can be found under the /games and /research tabs.
