Two new pieces of writing, continuing on my reading of Plato's Phaedo, "Logic of Scission." The first, "Dying Well," a critique of Plato's argument on the basis of discoveries in #science since his writing: <https://steinea.github.io/notes/2022/05/14/dying-well>.

The second, "Dying Well, 2: Kinetics and Cosmology," taking up the entropic paradigm, contrary to Plato, as articulated by Thomas Nail: <https://steinea.github.io/notes/2022/05/23/dying-well-2>

This now three-part series has been a fun exercise in #philosophy, #cosmology, and #ecology, considering how thought meets action in ethical day-to-day practice.
