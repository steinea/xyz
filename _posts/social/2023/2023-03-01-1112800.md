I'm hosting the #radicalfuturesjam in collaboration with SPRAG: The Society for the Promotion of Radical Analog Games. It runs until the end of April, and welcomes all who dream of transforming our social systems and networks of relation for the better.

<https://itch.io/jam/radical-futures>

We are looking for tabletop games that challenge existing hierarchies, power relations, and inequalities, that reinvent social institutions, and that transform people and communities so we can live in peace, abundance, and with ecological care.

The jam is open to all tabletop formats, and takes an expansive approach to the definition of games. For prompts, suggestions, and further guidelines, click through to the jam page linked above.
