We went to the Gibsons Public Art Gallery on the weekend and saw a wonderful collection of paintings and sculptures by Gabriela Hirt, "Storied Bodies." I found this scene arranged in the middle of the space to be quite captivating. More of Hirt's work can be found at her site: https://www.gabrielahirt.com/
