#### Henry Jenkins, “Game Design as Narrative Architecture”

"Not all games tell stories" (119)

"Many games *do* have narrative aspirations" (119)

"There is not one future of games" (119-20)

"The experience of playing games can never be simply reduced to the experience of a story" (120)

"If some games tell stories, they are unlikely to tell them in the same way that other media tell stories" (120)

"Game designers don't simply tell stories; they design worlds and sculpt spaces" (121)

"games fit within a much older tradition of spatial stories, which have often taken the form of hero's odysseys, quest myths, or travel narratives" (122)

"When game designers draw story elements from existing film or literary genres, they are most apt to tap those genres---fantasy, adventure, science fiction, horror, war---which are most invested in world-making and spatial storytelling" (122)

"spatial stories can evoke pre-existing narrative assocations; they can provide a staging ground where narrative events are enacted; they may embed narrative information within their mise-en-scence; or they provide resources for emergent narratives" (123)

"Spatial stories are not badly constructed stories; rather, they are stories that respond to alternative aesthetic principles, privileging spatial exploration over plot development" (124)
