#### Brenda Laurel, “Piercing the Spectacle”

"the Spectacle provides a glittering array of substitutes for the experience of personal agency" (867)

"Fewer and fewer opportunities for action outside the Spectacle present themselves to us. We must seek them out" (867)

"The spectacle holds us fast" (867)

"the pleasure of interactivity is preferable to boredom" (868)

"Game designers have it in their power to reconstruct notions of personal awareness, choice, and agency in ways that might seriously disturb the consumerist ethos that has been prepared for us" (869)
