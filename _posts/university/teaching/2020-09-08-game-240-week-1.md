#### Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman, *The Game Design Reader*, “What Is a Game?”

"The real question is not *what* the definition is, but *why* games require such definitions and *how* they can be utilized" (80)

"In fact, in some way, every essay in *The Game Design Reader* contains an implicit definition of the term 'game'" (80)

"Definitions are concepts that do work: they are, to quote MIT scientist Marvin Minsky, 'things to think with.' In identifying what games are and what they are not, in using definitions to refashion our preconceptions of games, we can open up new spaces to see what games are, what they should be, and what they might become" (80)

#### Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman, *The Game Design Reader*, “What Is Play?”

"Games create play, of that there is no doubt" (83)

"Where is play found? What form does it take? And why does it matter anyway?" (83)

There is "something fundamentally unknowable and ephemeral about play, something mysterious and exciting. Play surprises and delights us, moves and transforms us" (85)

"Make it elegant. Design for innovation. And above all, play like you mean it" (86)
