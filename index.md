Hello, world! Welcome to my miscellany. A counterpart to my other sites for [writing](https://steinea.ca/) and [identity](https://steinea.fyi/), this in turn is my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/), [memex](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/about.html), or [thought cabinet](https://discoelysium.fandom.com/wiki/Thought_Cabinet).

I am a gameplay producer at Electronic Arts, a former game development instructor and current games researcher, a designer and publisher of tabletop games, and an occasional poet.

I am located in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia. I work and live on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territories of the Stó꞉lō, Mathxwí, Semá:th, and Kwantlen First Nations.

#### Activity

Tracking for hobbies using liquid generators and frontmatter to produce activity feeds from pages in my inventory and garden. For a more high level summary, see my [Now](https://steinea.fyi/now/) page.

<!-- Drinking, Listening, Sleeping, Traveling -->

#### Codex

Cross-reference for my garden and library, using pre-defined liquid generators in combination with [tags](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) and conditional liquid generators in my [page.html](https://github.com/steinea/xyz/blob/main/_layouts/page.html) layout to procedurally build lists of related pages.

#### Garden

My personal wiki of bookmarks from across the web, presented in three different views for a variety of approaches to discovery.

<br>


#### Inventory

Records of my physical media, collectibles, and other durables, generated from a mix of standard pages and [data](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/) files, and cross-referenced with codex and library.

#### Library

Pages split from my garden due to volume and complexity, heavily cross-referenced with activity and codex.
