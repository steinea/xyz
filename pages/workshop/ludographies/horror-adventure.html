<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_horror" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>: "Starting with the release of Resident Evil 4 in 2005, the [survival horror] genre began to incorporate more features from action games and more traditional first person and third-person shooter games. This has led game journalists to question whether long-standing survival horror franchises and more recent franchises have abandoned the genre and moved into a distinct genre often referred to as 'action horror.'<a href="http://www.gamerevolution.com/manifesto/survival-horror-vs-action-horror-10399" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a><a href="http://metro.co.uk/2013/06/25/the-evil-within-preview-real-survival-horror-3855378/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[2]</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140721110927/http://www.zero1gaming.com/2013/05/01/survival-horror-vs-action-horror/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[3]</a><a href="http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3229453/6-upcoming-horror-games-that-look-absolutely-terrifying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[4]</a> James Stephanie Sterling suggests that the genre lost its core gameplay when it improved the combat interface, thus shifting the gameplay away from hiding and running towards direct combat.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090404021610/http://www.destructoid.com/how-survival-horror-evolved-itself-into-extinction-114022.phtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[5]</a> Leigh Alexander argues that this represents a shift towards more Western horror aesthetics, which emphasize action and gore rather than the psychological experience of Japanese horror.<a href="https://kotaku.com/does-survival-horror-really-still-exist-5056008" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[6]</a>"</p>

<p>In its marketing, Fort Solis is described as a "horror adventure" game, and I like this descriptor even more than "action horror" due to its capaciousness. Horror adventure covers the many modalities of horror post-Resident Evil 4, helping formalize the relationships between different franchises that often have quite divergent mechanical affordances and genre trappings.</p>
