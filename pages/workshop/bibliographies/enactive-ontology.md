This bibliography was compiled in the process of doing research for my second doctoral application, "Actual Play: Notes for a Ludic Ontology," an examination of actual play podcast *Friends at the Table* through the lenses of hermeneutic phenomenology, philosophy of science, and cognitive science. Like my first doctoral application, this one was also unsuccessful. I got more traction with it, even finding myself on a short list of applicants at one university, but it was ultimately too niche to find an advisor willing to take me on. However, as is my wont, I carried on compiling research under five distinct headings, each conveniently prefixed 'post': postcognitivism, postessentialism, postphenomenology, postpositivism, and postsemiotics.
