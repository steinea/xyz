This is a weird bibliography, so some context is warranted. I am subscribed to Magnus Midtb√∏'s channel for his climbing videos, but he also does fitness challenges, and went on a real military challenge kick, one of which was with the U.S. Marine Corps. It's quite a subculture, and the combat challenges are quite extreme, so I found myself reading while watching and collected the below sources.
