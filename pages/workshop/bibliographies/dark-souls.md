This bibliography was originally compiled as part of my research for my first doctoral application, "Thinking Through Play: Toward a Reading of *Dark Souls*," an examination of the game through Espen Aarseth's *Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature*. This application was ultimately unsuccessful, but I since went on to write several papers on *Dark Souls* and related games, and to continue exploring paratextual materials for the series.
