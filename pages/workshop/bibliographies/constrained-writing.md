From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_writing):

Outside of established traditions, particularly in the avant-garde, writers have produced a variety of work under more severe constraints; this is often what the term "constrained writing" is specifically applied to. For example:

* Reverse-lipograms: each word must contain a particular letter.
* Univocalic poetry, using only one vowel.
* Mandated vocabulary, where the writer must include specific words (for example, Quadrivial Quandary solicits individual sentences containing all four words in a daily selection).
* Bilingual homophonous poetry, where the poem makes sense in two different languages at the same time, constituting two simultaneous homophonous poems.
* Alliteratives or tautograms, in which every word must start with the same letter (or subset of letters; see Alphabetical Africa).
* Lipogram: a letter (commonly e or o) is outlawed.
* Acrostics: first letter of each word/sentence/paragraph forms a word or sentence.
* Abecedarius: first letter of each word/verse/section goes through the alphabet.
* Palindromes, such as the word "radar", read the same forwards and backwards.
* Anglish, favouring Anglo-Saxon words over Greek and Roman/Latin words.
* Pilish, where the lengths of consecutive words match the digits of the number p.
* Anagrams, words or sentences formed by rearranging the letters of another.
* Limitations in punctuation, such as Peter Carey's book True History of the Kelly Gang, which features no commas.
* One syllable article, a form unique to Chinese literature, using many characters all of which are homophones; the result looks sensible as writing but is very confusing when read aloud.
* Chaterism, where the length of words in a phrase or sentence increases or decreases in a uniform, mathematical way.
* Aleatory, where the reader supplies a random input.
* Erasure, which involves erasing words from an existing text and framing the result on the page as a poem.

The Oulipo group is a gathering of writers who use such techniques. The Outrapo group uses theatrical constraints.

There are a number of constrained writing forms that are restricted by length, including:

* Six-Word Memoirs: 6 words
* Haiku: ~ 3 lines (5–7–5 syllables or 2–3–2 beats recommended.)
* Minisaga: 50 words, +15 for title
* Drabble: 100 words
* Twiction: espoused as a specifically constrained form of microfiction where a story or poem is exactly 140 characters long.
* Sijo: three lines average 14–16 syllables, for a total of 44–46: theme (3, 4,4,4); elaboration (3,4,4,4); counter-theme (3,5) and completion (4,3).
