From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_6):

"Battlefield 6 is a 2025 first-person shooter game developed by Battlefield Studios and published by Electronic Arts. Serving as the eighteenth installment in the Battlefield series, the game was released for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S on October 10, 2025. The single-player campaign is set between 2027 and 2028 and features a conflict between a fractured NATO and Pax Armata, a private military company. The multiplayer mode features four character classes: Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon, who each specialize with different weapons and combat strategies, and has several returning game modes with the new Escalation mode being added."
