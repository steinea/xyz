"Injustice: Gods Among Us is a 2013 fighting game developed by NetherRealm Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 3, Wii U, and Xbox 360. It is the first installment in the Injustice franchise based upon the fictional universe of DC Comics. It was released in April 2013 in North America, Europe, and Australia, and June 2013 in Japan. An expanded version of the game, titled Injustice: Gods Among Us â€“ Ultimate Edition, was released in November 2013 for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Windows, and Xbox 360. A free-to-play mobile app based on Injustice was also released for iOS and Android devices, which was then ported to arcade machines by Raw Thrills in the fall of 2017, months after the sequel's release. A prequel comic book series of the same name, written by Tom Taylor, was released beginning in January 2013."
