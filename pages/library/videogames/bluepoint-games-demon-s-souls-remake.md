From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon%27s_Souls_(2020_video_game)):

"Demon's Souls is a 2020 action role-playing game developed by Bluepoint Games and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 5. The game was released as a launch title for the PlayStation 5 in November. It is a remake of Demon's Souls, originally developed by FromSoftware for the PlayStation 3 in 2009. Japan Studio's Internal Development Department assisted development on the remake, which makes Demonâ€™s Souls its last game before its integration into Team Asobi. Demon's Souls received critical acclaim, who praised its gameplay, visuals, technical aspects, and improvements over the original game. It had sold 1.8 million copies by 2023."
