From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_Gaiden_4):

"Ninja Gaiden 4 is an upcoming action-adventure game co-developed by Team Ninja and PlatinumGames, and published by Xbox Game Studios. It is the seventh mainline game in Koei Tecmo's Ninja Gaiden series, and the direct sequel to Ninja Gaiden 3 (2012). The game primarily follows a new character named Yakumo, though series' protagonist Ryu Hayabusa is also playable and has a significant role in the story. Ninja Gaiden 4 is set to be released worldwide for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S in late 2025."
