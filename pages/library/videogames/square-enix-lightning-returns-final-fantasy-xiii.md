From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Returns:_Final_Fantasy_XIII):

> Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII is an action role-playing game developed and published by [[Square Enix]]. It is a sequel to Final Fantasy XIII-2, concludes the storyline of Final Fantasy XIII, and forms part of the [[Fabula Nova Crystallis]] subseries. It was released in 2013 in Japan and 2014 in North America and PAL regions, and was ported to Windows in 2015 and Android and iOS through cloud gaming in 2016 in Japan. Lightning Returns employs a highly revamped version of the gameplay system from the previous two games, with an action-oriented battle system, the ability to customize the player character's outfits, and a time limit the player must extend by completing story missions and side quests.
