From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Wake):

"Alan Wake is a 2010 action-adventure game developed by Remedy Entertainment and published by Microsoft Game Studios. The game was released in May 2010 for the Xbox 360, with a Windows version following in February 2012 and a remastered version released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows in October 2021, as well as a Nintendo Switch version in October 2022. The story follows bestselling crime thriller novelist Alan Wake as he tries to uncover the mystery behind his wife's disappearance during a vacation in the small fictional town of Bright Falls, Washington, all while experiencing events from the plot of his latest novel, which he cannot remember writing, coming to life ... Remedy announced a remaster of Alan Wake on The Sudden Stop, a Remedy fansite, in early September 2021. The remaster was co-developed by Remedy and D3T, and was distributed through Epic Games Publishing. Alan Wake Remastered was released on October 5, 2021, for Windows, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, and for the first time on the PlayStation platform via PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. It was released for Nintendo Switch on 20 October 2022. Remedy felt a remaster was the better route than a remake, maintaining the core gameplay and narrative elements of the game but improving the visuals for newer game systems with support for 4K resolutions so that the title would appeal to both those that played the original and new players."
