From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Age:_The_Veilguard):

"Dragon Age: The Veilguard is a 2024 action role-playing game developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts. It is the fourth major game in the Dragon Age franchise, and the sequel to Dragon Age: Inquisition (2014) ... The game began development in 2015 and was affected by lengthy delays. Originally planned as a live-service game, the game was re-envisioned as a single-player title following the success of EA's Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order (2019); the game's approach to combat was influenced by Sony's God of War (2018). It was originally announced as Dragon Age: Dreadwolf in 2022, and retitled Dragon Age: The Veilguard in June 2024."
