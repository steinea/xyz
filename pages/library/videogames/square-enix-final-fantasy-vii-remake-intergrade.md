From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII_Remake):

> Final Fantasy VII Remake is an action role-playing game by [[Square Enix]] and released for PlayStation 4 in April 2020 and serves as a sequel to all the games as its part of the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII. An enhanced version, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, was released for PlayStation 5 and Windows in 2021.
>
> Final Fantasy VII Remake is the first in a planned trilogy of games remaking the 1997 PlayStation game Final Fantasy VII. Set in the dystopian cyberpunk metropolis of Midgar, players control the mercenary Cloud Strife. He joins AVALANCHE, an eco-terrorist group trying to stop the powerful megacorporation Shinra from using the planet's life essence as an energy source. The gameplay combines real-time action with role-playing elements.
>
> Final Fantasy VII Remake was announced in 2015 following years of speculation. Several key staff members from the original game returned for the title, including character designer and original story writer [[Tetsuya Nomura]] as director, director and writer Yoshinori Kitase as producer, writer and event planner Kazushige Nojima as story and scenario writer, event planner [[Motomu Toriyama]] as a co-director, and composer Nobuo Uematsu who returned to write the main theme. The staff redesigned the characters to balance realism and stylization.
