From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioShock:_The_Collection):

"BioShock: The Collection is a 2016 video game compilation developed by Blind Squirrel Games and published by 2K. The Collection features upgraded versions of BioShock, BioShock 2 and BioShock Infinite, with new textures and support for higher resolution displays and framerates. The compilation was released in September 2016 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows; versions for macOS and Nintendo Switch followed in August 2017 and May 2020, respectively. ...

BioShock and BioShock 2 were remastered for the collection, with higher-resolution textures and new effects. The collection adds a director's commentary called Imagining BioShock, featuring the series' creative director Ken Levine and lead artist Shawn Robertson. Players unlock episodes of the commentary by finding new collectible objects added to the remastered BioShock."
