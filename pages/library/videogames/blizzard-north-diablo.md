From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_(video_game)):

"Diablo is an action role-playing video game developed by Blizzard North and released by Blizzard Entertainment in January 1997, and is the first installment in the video game series of the same name. Set in the fictional Kingdom of Khanduras in the mortal realm, the player controls a lone hero battling to rid the world of Diablo, the Lord of Terror. Beneath the town of Tristram, the player journeys through sixteen randomly generated dungeon levels, ultimately entering Hell in order to face Diablo. An expansion pack, Diablo: Hellfire, was released in November 1997 by Synergistic Software."
