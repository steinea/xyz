From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II#Remaster):

"In November 2023, following a PlayStation Store listing leak, Naughty Dog announced a remastered version of the game, titled The Last of Us Part II Remastered. It was released for the PlayStation 5 on January 19, 2024; existing owners can purchase the game digitally for US$10. A special edition version, including a SteelBook case, trading cards, patch, and pins, was made available in some regions. Remastered features visual improvements, faster loading times, DualSense integration, audio description, a speedrun-focused mode, and an audio commentary for cutscenes featuring Druckmann, Gross, Johnson, Baker, Bailey, and Woodward. Some journalists and players questioned whether the game needed a remaster within four years of its initial release, though others felt it was justified by the additions and price point."
