From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scythe_(board_game)#Alternate_versions):

> In 2018, Scythe: Digital Edition, a video game, was released by Asmodee Digital as a digital adaptation of Scythe. The game was released on 5 September 2018 on Steam for PC, including both Mac and Windows. In 2020, a mobile version was subsequently released and available to download on iOS and Android. Iron Harvest, a real-time strategy game inspired by Scythe's 1920s setting, was also released in September 2020, and was positively received for its artwork and thematic setting.
