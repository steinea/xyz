From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astro_Bot):

> Astro Bot is a 2024 platform game developed by Team Asobi and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 5 to coincide with PlayStation's 30th anniversary. Following Astro's Playroom (2020), it is the fifth overall installment in the Astro Bot series and marks Team Asobi's first game developed since its separation from Japan Studio. As the titular protagonist Astro, the player embarks on a quest to save lost Bots, retrieve parts for the PlayStation 5 mothership, and defeat the alien Space Bully Nebulax, who had originally destroyed the mothership. Like its predecessor, the game takes full advantage of the DualSense controller.
