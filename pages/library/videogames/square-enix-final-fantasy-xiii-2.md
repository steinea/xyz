From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XIII-2):

> Final Fantasy XIII-2 is a role-playing video game developed and published by [[Square Enix]] for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It was released in 2011 in Japan and 2012 in North America and PAL regions, and was ported to Windows in 2014 and Android and iOS through cloud gaming in 2015 in Japan. XIII-2 is a direct sequel to the 2009 role-playing game Final Fantasy XIII and part of the [[Fabula Nova Crystallis]] subseries. It includes modified features from the previous game, including fast-paced combat and a customizable "Paradigm" system to control which abilities are used by the characters, and adds a new system that allows monsters to be captured and used in battle. The game's plot features a heavy time travel element, allowing the player to jump between different times at the same location or different places at the same time. Lightning, the protagonist of the original game, has disappeared into an unknown world. Her younger sister Serah Farron and Noel Kreiss journey through time in an attempt to find her.
