From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_Core:_Final_Fantasy_VII#Crisis_Core:_Final_Fantasy_VII_Reunion):

> In 2022, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the original Final Fantasy VII, a remake, entitled Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion, was released on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. Co-developed with Tose, who previously collaborated with [[Square Enix]] for World of Final Fantasy (2016), the graphics have been converted to HD, including new 3D models for all elements. The game also includes a newly arranged soundtrack and full voice acting for all dialogue. Originally, there were no plans for a big update in graphics until the team decided it would look similar to Remake. While the story remains the same from the original version, Reunion is part of the larger Final Fantasy VII Remake project, being considered a prequel to the three-part remake series. Reunion also features an updated combat system that is a combination of the original battle system and "something close" to the one featured in [[Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade]]. While Square expanded new elements from the story of Remake, Reunion was made to come across as faithful as possible to the original game. Camerawork and motions have also been adjusted and all of the summons cutscenes have been completely remade. A hard mode was added for the Japanese version for the first time as the Western one had it.
