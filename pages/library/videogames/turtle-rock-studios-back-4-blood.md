From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_4_Blood):

"Back 4 Blood is a 2021 first-person shooter game developed by Turtle Rock Studios and published by Warner Bros. Games. It was released on October 12, 2021, for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. The game is considered to be a spiritual successor to the Left 4 Dead series, and carries over several key gameplay pillars, such as a strong emphasis on cooperative teamwork, and an AI system called the 'Game Director', which dynamically modifies the environment, placement of enemies, items, and obstacles in response to players' progression and behavior."
