From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodstained:_Curse_of_the_Moon_2):

> Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon 2 is a platform video game developed and published by Inti Creates. It was released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One, on July 10, 2020. It is the third game in the Bloodstained series and a direct sequel to Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon, itself a spin-off of Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night. The game's graphics and gameplay are done in an 8-bit retro style meant to mimic the early Castlevania games.
