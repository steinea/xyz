From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_of_Exile):

"Path of Exile is a free-to-play action role-playing video game developed and published by Grinding Gear Games. Following an open beta phase, the game was released for Microsoft Windows in October 2013. A version for Xbox One was released in August 2017, and a PlayStation 4 version was released in March 2019 ... The game borrows heavily from the Diablo series, particularly Diablo II,[7] of which Path of Exile has been described as the spiritual successor."
