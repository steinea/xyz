From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenoblade_Chronicles_X#Definitive_Edition):

"Xenoblade Chronicles X is a 2015 action role-playing game developed by Monolith Soft and published by Nintendo for the Wii U. The game is part of the Xenoblade Chronicles series, itself forming part of the wider Xeno metaseries. Carrying over several gameplay elements from the original game, players explore the open world planet Mira, completing a variety of quests and unlocking new regions to explore and gather resources from across its five continents. The story follows a surviving human ship after escaping an alien battle which destroys Earth, with the player character joining the BLADE unit to defend the human survivors and uncover Mira's secrets ... In 2018, Takahashi stated that he wanted to bring the game to Nintendo Switch, but cited difficulties with both funding and its scale. In October 2024, Nintendo announced a remaster of the game for the Switch, being released worldwide on March 20, 2025, titled Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition. The remaster, which is based on the Western version incorporating the DLC, includes remastered graphics, a continuation of the original narrative, a new area related to that, and two new companion characters. Sawano returned to co-compose new music with anime composer Misaki Umase."
