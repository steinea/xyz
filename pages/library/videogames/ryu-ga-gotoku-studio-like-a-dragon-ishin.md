From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_a_Dragon:_Ishin!#Remake):

"On September 14, 2022, the Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio official Twitter account announced a remake of RyÅ« ga Gotoku Ishin! titled Like a Dragon: Ishin!, which was released on February 21, 2023. The decision to bring over Ishin! was influenced by success of Western titles like Ghost of Tsushima, which also shared the premise of a historical samurai setting."
