From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balatro):

"Balatro is a 2024 poker-themed roguelike deck-building game developed by LocalThunk and published by Playstack. It was released on Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on February 20, 2024, with a port to macOS on March 1. Ports for Android and iOS were released on September 26, 2024. In the game, the player must score a certain number of points by playing poker hands from a starting 52-card deck, with a limited number of hands and discards each round. The number of points required to pass a round becomes progressively higher as the game goes on, but the player's cards also become more powerful."
