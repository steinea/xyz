From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draugen_(video_game)):

"Draugen is a 2019 first-person mystery adventure video game developed by Red Thread Games for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Set in the 1920s, the plot entails an American naturalist visiting a Norwegian fishing village to find that the town's population has vanished. The player must explore the town, discover its fate and survive the night. The game emphasizes the more sinister aspects of Norwegian folklore."
