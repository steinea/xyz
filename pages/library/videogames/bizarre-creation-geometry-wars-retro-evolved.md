From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry_Wars:_Retro_Evolved):

> Geometry Wars is a 2003 video game by Bizarre Creations. Initially a minigame in Project Gotham Racing 2, an updated version, titled Retro Evolved, was eventually released for the Xbox 360. That version, at one point, held the record for the most downloaded Xbox Live Arcade Game.
