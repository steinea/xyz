From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Miles_Morales):

"Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a 2020 action-adventure game developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. Based on the Marvel Comics character Miles Morales, it is inspired by both the character's decade-long comic book mythology and appearances in other media. The game is a spin-off and continuation of Marvel's Spider-Man (2018), and the second installment in Insomniac's Spider-Man series ... Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales was officially revealed in June 2020 and launched that November for PlayStation 4 and as a launch title for PlayStation 5. A Windows version was later released in November 2022."
