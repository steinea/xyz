From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_Gaiden_(2004_video_game)):

"Ninja Gaiden is a 2004 action-adventure game developed by Team Ninja and published by Tecmo for the Xbox. It was released in March 2004. A reboot of the franchise, the game is set in a futuristic version of the 21st century, where players control Ryu Hayabusa, a master ninja, in his quest to recover a stolen sword and avenge the slaughter of his clan. It was inspired by Tecmo's Ninja Gaiden series, and is set in the same continuity as Team Ninja's Dead or Alive fighting games ... In 2007, Ninja Gaiden was ported to PlayStation 3 as Ninja Gaiden Sigma, with graphical improvements, and even though some extra content was added, a lot of the original content and mechanics got altered."
