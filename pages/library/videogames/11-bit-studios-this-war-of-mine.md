From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_War_of_Mine):

> This War of Mine is a war survival video game developed and published by the Polish game development company 11 Bit Studios. The game, inspired by the siege of Sarajevo among other conflicts, differs from most war-themed video games by focusing on the civilian experience of war rather than front line combat. Characters have to make many difficult decisions in order to survive everyday dangers. There are various endings for each character, depending on the decisions made in the game. The game has received multiple DLCs and sold over 9 million units worldwide across multiple platforms.
