From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies_of_P):

"Lies of P is a 2023 action role-playing game developed by Neowiz and Round8 Studio and published by Neowiz. Loosely based on Carlo Collodi's 1883 novel, The Adventures of Pinocchio, the story follows the titular puppet traversing the fictional city of Krat, plagued by both an epidemic of petrification disease and a puppet uprising. Lies of P is played from a third-person perspective, with the player using melee weapons and a mechanical arm equipped with various tools to fight hostile puppets, factions, and citizens disfigured by the disease. Throughout the game, the player makes decisions at key plot points that affect the story. In addition to Collodi's novel, the team drew inspiration from the Belle Ã‰poque period and the Soulslike genre. The game was released for macOS, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S in September 2023."
