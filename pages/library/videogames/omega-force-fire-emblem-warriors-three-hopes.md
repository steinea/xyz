From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Emblem_Warriors:_Three_Hopes):

"Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes is a 2022 hack and slash action role-playing game developed by Omega Force and published by Koei Tecmo in Japan and Nintendo internationally for the Nintendo Switch. Part of the Fire Emblem series created by Intelligent Systems, it is both a spin-off of Fire Emblem: Three Houses (2019) and a successor to Fire Emblem Warriors (2017), similarly acting as a crossover between the mechanics of Fire Emblem and the Warriors franchise owned by Koei Tecmo (which Omega Force is a division of)."
