From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Dragon_Pass):

> King of Dragon Pass is a 1999 strategy simulation fantasy video game published by A Sharp. Set in the fictional world of Glorantha, the player controls the fate of a barbarian clan settling in the dangerous frontier region of Dragon Pass. Originally released for PC, the game was a commercial failure. It was ported for iOS in 2011, and was later released for Android and re-released for PCs. The iOS versions were much more commercially successful than the original PC release, leading to a sequel, Six Ages: Ride Like The Wind, being released in 2018.
