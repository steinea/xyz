From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel%27s_Midnight_Suns):

"Marvel's Midnight Suns is a 2022 tactical role-playing game developed by Firaxis Games and published by 2K. The game features comic book characters from multiple Marvel Comics properties, such as Midnight Sons, Avengers, X-Men, and Runaways. Players are able to create their own superhero named 'The Hunter', who must lead other characters to rebel against Lilith, the 'mother of demons' as she attempts to bring her master, Chthon, back to life. Combat in the game is turn-based and mixed with deck-building. Between combat missions, players manage their base of operations called 'The Abbey' which they can walk around in a third-person view, research upgrades, interact with the game's cast of characters and build friendships with them."
