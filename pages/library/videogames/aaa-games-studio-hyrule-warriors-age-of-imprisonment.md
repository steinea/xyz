"Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is an upcoming hack and slash game developed by Koei Tecmo's AAA Games Studio and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch 2. Like its predecessors, Age of Imprisonment is a crossover that mixes the world and characters of Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda series with the gameplay of Koei Tecmo's Dynasty Warriors series, and serves as a prequel to The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (2023). Age of Imprisonment is set to release Winter 2025."
