From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel%27s_Guardians_of_the_Galaxy):

"Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is a 2021 action-adventure game developed by Eidos-Montr√©al and originally published by Square Enix. Set in an original universe based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name, the game's plot follows the Guardians who, while attempting to capture a beast for a wealthy collector, inadvertently trigger a catastrophe which threatens the peace of the galaxy. The player controls the team's self-proclaimed leader, Star-Lord, and issues commands to other Guardians including Drax the Destroyer, Gamora, Rocket Raccoon and Groot."
