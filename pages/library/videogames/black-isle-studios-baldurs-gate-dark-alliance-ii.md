From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate:_Dark_Alliance_II):

"Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II is a 2004 hack and slash action role-playing game for PlayStation 2 and Xbox developed by Black Isle Studios and published by Interplay Entertainment, with distribution handled by Vivendi Universal Games in North America and Avalon Interactive/Acclaim Entertainment in Europe. It is the sequel to the 2001 game Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance ... The use of the Dark Alliance game engine led to a lawsuit filed by the engine's creators, Snowblind Studios, against publisher Interplay, which alleged the engine had been used in the game without Snowblind's permission."
