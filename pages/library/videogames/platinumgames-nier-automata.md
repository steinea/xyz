From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nier:_Automata):

> Nier: Automata is a 2017 action role-playing game developed by [[PlatinumGames]] and published by [[Square Enix]]. It is a sequel to Nier (2010), itself a spin-off of and sequel to the Drakengard series. Nier: Automata was originally released for the PlayStation 4 and Windows via Steam, and an Xbox One port was published the following year. A Nintendo Switch port was released in 2022.

> Production began in 2014, with series creator [[Yoko Taro]], producer Yosuke Saito, and lead composer Keiichi Okabe reprising their roles in Nier. [[Akihiko Yoshida]], known for his work in the Final Fantasy series, led character design. The goal was to make a sequel game that would be faithful to Nier while improving the combat system. Because the project was new to PlatinumGames, its staff faced multiple challenges when developing the gameplay and open-world environment. The story, which was written by Yoko, explores themes of finding value in life and the reasons people kill.
