From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_of_Rain):

"Risk of Rain is a 2013 roguelike platform game developed by Hopoo Games. Initially made by a two-student team from the University of Washington using the GameMaker engine, the game was funded through Kickstarter before being released on Microsoft Windows in November 2013. Ports for OS X and Linux versions were released a year later, with console versions being released in the later half of the 2010s."
