From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fe_(video_game)):

"Fe is a platform-adventure game developed by Zoink and published by Electronic Arts under its EA Originals program. It was released on February 16, 2018 for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. In it, the player controls Fe, a fox-like creature in a forest setting, attempting to defend it from hostile entities called the Silent Ones, gaining help from other forest creatures by guiding them to complete tasks and learning new abilities from those it helps. Fe is the first game in the EA Originals series, which is EA's program created to promote indie developers."
