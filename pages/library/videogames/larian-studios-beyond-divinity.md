From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_Divinity):

"Beyond Divinity is an action role-playing game by Larian Studios released in 2004. It is a sequel to Divine Divinity. A Deluxe Edition was also released that same year, containing copies of both Beyond Divinity and Divine Divinity. In 2009 a digital download version was released, equivalent to the updated disc version ... The gameplay is heavily based on Divine Divinity, but adds the ability for the player to control two characters, each with their own stats and equipment."
