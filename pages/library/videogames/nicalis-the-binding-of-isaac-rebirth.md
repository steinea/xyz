From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Binding_of_Isaac:_Rebirth):

"The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a 2014 roguelike action-adventure game designed by Edmund McMillen and developed and published by Nicalis. Rebirth was released for Linux, Microsoft Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in November 2014, for Xbox One, New Nintendo 3DS and Wii U in July 2015, for iOS in January 2017 and for Nintendo Switch in March 2017. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions were released in November 2021.

Rebirth is a remake of The Binding of Isaac, which was developed by McMillen and Florian Himsl and released in 2011 as an Adobe Flash application. This platform had limitations and led McMillen to work with Nicalis to produce Rebirth with a more advanced game engine, which in turn enabled the substantial addition of content and gameplay features. Since release, Rebirth has had four expansions: Afterbirth (2015), Afterbirth+ (2017), Repentance (2021) and Repentance+ (2024) with more game content and gameplay modes. Afterbirth+ also added support for user-created content."
