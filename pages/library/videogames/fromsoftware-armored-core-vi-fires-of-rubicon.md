> Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is a 2023 mecha-based vehicular combat game developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. It is another reboot of the series, set in a distant future on a remote planet where a war erupts between corporations, the government and the local residents for the control of a rare and valuable resource only available there.

> The game is the first entry in the Armored Core series since Armored Core: Verdict Day (2013) and was released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on August 25. It received generally positive reviews from critics and is the highest-selling entry in the series, selling three million copies by July 2024.
