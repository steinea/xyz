From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nier_Reincarnation):

> Nier Reincarnation is a 2021 role-playing video game developed by Applibot and published by Square Enix for Android and iOS devices. The game is part of the Nier universe, forming part of the wider Drakengard series. Set in a realm called the Cage, the game follows the story arcs of multiple characters, each exploring their own troubled pasts and a greater outside threat. Gameplay is split between exploration within the Cage and narratives dubbed Weapon Stories, and turn-based battles against monsters infesting the Weapon Stories. The game is free-to-play, incorporating a gacha-based system for character variants and weapons.
>
> Production began following the success of [[Nier Automata]] (2017), with the aim of making an accessible mobile entry in the Nier universe. Series creator [[Yoko Taro]] acted as creative director, and contributed to the scenario. Other returning staff included producer Yosuke Saito, artists Akihiko Yoshida and Kazuma Koda, and co-composer Keiichi Okabe. The title is set to end service worldwide on April 29, 2024. The game saw commercial success, reaching fifteen million downloads worldwide by September 2021. Journalists gave mixed to positive reviews; praise was given to its writing, art design and music, while the gacha system was often criticized.
