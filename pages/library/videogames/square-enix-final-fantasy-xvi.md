Producer: [[Naoki Yoshida]]

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XVI):

> Final Fantasy XVI is a 2023 action role-playing game developed and published by Square Enix. The sixteenth main installment in the Final Fantasy series, it was released for the PlayStation 5. The game features segmented open environments and an action-based combat system involving melee and magic-based attacks. There are recurring series features including Chocobos for area travel, and summoned monsters called Eikons, which are both fought as bosses and used through channelling their power in combat.

> Beginning concept development in 2015, the staff included [[Naoki Yoshida]] as producer, Hiroshi Takai as main director, artists Hiroshi Minagawa and Kazuya Takahashi, Kazutoyo Maehiro as creative director and lead writer, Masayoshi Soken as composer, and Capcom veteran Ryota Suzuki as battle designer. Yoshida's aim was for a dark fantasy storyline that would have broad appeal and reinvigorate the series. Its production and promotion were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and later by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The game was praised by critics for its story, graphics, music, and gameplay. Criticism focused on lack of role-playing elements, technical issues, and side quest design. The game sold over three million units during its first week after launch.
