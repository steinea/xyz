From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Breath_of_the_Wild):

"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a 2017 action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo. Set at the end of the Zelda timeline, the player controls an amnesiac Link as he sets out to save Princess Zelda and prevent Calamity Ganon from destroying the world. Players explore the open world of Hyrule while they collect items and complete objectives such as puzzles and side quests. Breath of the Wild's world is unstructured and encourages exploration and experimentation; the story can be completed in a nonlinear fashion. Released on March 3, 2017, for the Wii U and Nintendo Switch, Breath of the Wild was first planned as a 2015 Wii U exclusive before becoming a launch game for the Switch."
