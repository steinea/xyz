From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jusant):

"Jusant is a 2023 puzzle platform game developed and published by Don't Nod. The player controls a lone wanderer as they climb a desolate tower, filled with the artifacts of civilizations long past. The game was released for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S on 31 October 2023. It received positive reviews from critics, but was a commercial disappointment for Don't Nod."
