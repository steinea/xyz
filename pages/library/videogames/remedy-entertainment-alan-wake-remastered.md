From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Wake):

"Remedy announced a remaster of Alan Wake on The Sudden Stop, a Remedy fansite, in early September 2021. The remaster was co-developed by Remedy and D3T, and was distributed through Epic Games Publishing. Alan Wake Remastered was released on October 5, 2021, for Windows, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, and for the first time on the PlayStation platform via PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. It was released for Nintendo Switch on 20 October 2022. Remedy felt a remaster was the better route than a remake, maintaining the core gameplay and narrative elements of the game but improving the visuals for newer game systems with support for 4K resolutions so that the title would appeal to both those that played the original and new players."
