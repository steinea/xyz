"Persona 3: Dancing in Moonlight and Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight are 2018 rhythm games by Atlus for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita. Forming part of the Persona series—itself part of the larger Megami Tensei franchise—the games respectively feature the central casts of the 2006 role-playing video game Persona 3 and the 2016 role-playing video game Persona 5. Gameplay focuses on characters from Persona 3 or Persona 5 taking part in rhythm-based gameplay set to original and remixed music from Persona 3 or Persona 5."
