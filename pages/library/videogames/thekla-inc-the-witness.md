From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witness_(2016_video_game)):

"The Witness is a 2016 puzzle video game developed and published by Thekla, Inc.[b] Inspired by Myst, the game involves the exploration of an open world island filled with natural and man-made structures. The player progresses by solving puzzles around the island. The game provides no direct instructions for how these puzzles are to be solved, requiring the player to identify the meaning of symbols in the puzzles. A central design element to the game was how these puzzles are presented so that the player can achieve a moment of inspiration through trial and error and gain that comprehension themselves."
