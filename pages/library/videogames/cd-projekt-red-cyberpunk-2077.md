From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2077):

> Cyberpunk 2077 is a 2020 action role-playing game developed by CD Projekt Red, and published by CD Projekt, and based on Mike Pondsmith's Cyberpunk tabletop game series. The plot is set in the fictional metropolis of Night City, California, within the dystopian Cyberpunk universe. The player assumes the role of V (voiced by Gavin Drea/Cherami Leigh), a mercenary who accidentally gets imbued with a cybernetic "bio-chip" containing an engram of legendary rockstar and terrorist Johnny Silverhand (voiced by Keanu Reeves). As Johnny’s behaviour and memories begin overwriting V’s own, the two must work together to separate from each other and save V's life.
