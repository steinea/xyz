From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Fallen):

"Atlas Fallen is an action role-playing video game developed by Deck13 Interactive and published by Focus Entertainment. The game was released for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S on 10 August 2023. It received mixed reviews from critics ... Atlas Fallen is being developed by Deck13 Interactive using their in-house engine Fledge. According to design director Jérémy Hartvick, the game is not a "Soulslike" like the studio's previous games, Lords of the Fallen and The Surge. Instead, its combat system emphasizes speed and fluidity, and that the game's overall design was inspired by games such as God of War (2018) and the Horizon series. Nonetheless, staples from The Surge games such as a body targeting system were incorporated into Atlas Fallen. The game offers three difficulty modes, with the hard mode designed for veteran players of Soulslike games."
