From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadence_of_Hyrule):

"Cadence of Hyrule: Crypt of the NecroDancer Featuring The Legend of Zelda is a 2019 rhythm game developed by Brace Yourself Games and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. The game is a crossover between Crypt of the NecroDancer and Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda series, combining the rhythm-based movement and fighting mechanics with elements reminiscent of earlier games in the Zelda franchise."
