From [Wikipedia](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2330500/BETON_BRUTAL/):

> Climb a massive overgrown concrete tower while constantly at risk of falling and losing precious progress. BETON BRUTAL offers a fluid and responsive first person parkour experience through tranquil brutalist architecture.
