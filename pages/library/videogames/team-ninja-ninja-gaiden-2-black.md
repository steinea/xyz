From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_Gaiden_Sigma_2#Ninja_Gaiden_2_Black):

"Following the reveal of Ninja Gaiden 4 during the Xbox Developer Direct on January 23, 2025, Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo announced that an Unreal Engine 5 remaster, titled Ninja Gaiden 2 Black will launch later that day for PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox Series X/S and Xbox Game Pass. Calling it 'a definitive version' of Ninja Gaiden II in the vein of the original Ninja Gaiden Black, producer Fumihiko Yasuda explained that the idea came from feedback during the release of Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection in 2021, as many fans wanted to experience something closer to the original Xbox 360 game. The game aims to replicate the feel of the original Ninja Gaiden II by incorporating its upgrade system and restoring its level of blood and dismemberment. The enemy count was also increased, though not to the extent of the Xbox 360 version. As the remaster was built using Sigma 2 code, it retains most of its changes and additions, such as playable Ayane, Rachel and Momiji, revised enemy placement, costumes, Tag Missions, and the Black Dragon boss, but removes the Great Buddha and Statue of Liberty bosses, as well as the 'Ninja Race' mode. The 'Test of Valor' challenges, Mission Mode DLC and the Giant Death Worm boss fight that were removed in Sigma 2 are still absent in Ninja Gaiden 2 Black. The New Game Plus mode was also absent on launch but was added in a post-launch update."
