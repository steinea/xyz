From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_(2018_video_game)):

"Marvel's Spider-Man is a 2018 action-adventure game developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. The first installment in the Spider-Man game series, it is based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man and tells an original narrative that is inspired by the long-running comic book mythology, while also drawing from various adaptations in other media ... The game was followed by an expansion, The City That Never Sleeps, in late 2018. In November 2020, a remastered version of Marvel's Spider-Man was released for the PlayStation 5 alongside Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, a spin-off and continuation focused on Spider-Man's protégé Miles Morales. A sequel, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, was released in October 2023 for the PlayStation 5."
