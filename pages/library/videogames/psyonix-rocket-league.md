From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_League):

"Rocket League is a 2015 vehicular soccer video game developed and published by Psyonix. A sequel to 2008's Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars, Rocket League features up to eight players assigned to each of the two teams, using "rocket-powered" vehicles to hit a ball into their opponent's goal and score points over the course of a match. The game includes single-player and multiplayer modes that can be played both locally and online, including cross-platform play between all versions."
