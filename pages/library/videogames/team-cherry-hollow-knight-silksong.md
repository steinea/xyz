From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollow_Knight:_Silksong):

"Hollow Knight: Silksong is a 2025 Metroidvania video game developed and published by Australian independent developer Team Cherry. The sequel to Hollow Knight (2017), it was released on 4 September 2025 for Linux, macOS, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.

In Silksong, players control Hornet, the former Princess of Hollow Knight's fallen kingdom of Hallownest and a prominent supporting character from the original game. The story follows her as she is captured and transported to the mysterious new land of Pharloom, where she must navigate a vast, interconnected world filled with unique enemies, challenging bosses, and intricate environments. The game expands on the combat and traversal mechanics introduced in the first title, incorporating Hornet's agility and needle-based combat, as well as adding a quest system to encourage exploration and discovery. Originally planned as downloadable content for Hollow Knight, the project grew in scope over time, prompting Team Cherry to announce in February 2019 that it would instead become a full standalone sequel."
