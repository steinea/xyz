From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux_and_Fanny):

> Tux and Fanny is a video game developed by Albert Birney and Ghost Time Games, and published by Means Interactive in 2021. Described as a "retro-inspired puzzle game", Tux and Fanny is an adaptation of an animated film of the same name, directed by Birney in 2019. Players control the titular characters as they explore and discover their home and surroundings, collecting items and solving puzzles, whilst also completing secondary tasks such as bug collecting and bird-watching. Tux and Fanny was adapted by Birney with developer Gabriel Koenig of Ghost Time Games, with the game created in an open-ended process as an amalgamation of different ideas, artworks, writing, and mini-games. The game was released to a positive reception from reviewers, with publications praising its attention to detail, tone, and depiction of the minutiae of daily life. Tux and Fanny received the 'Most Amazing' Award at the Berlin A MAZE Festival and nominations at the Independent Games Festival in 2022.
