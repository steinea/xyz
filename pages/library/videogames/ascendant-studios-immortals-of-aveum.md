From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortals_of_Aveum):

"Immortals of Aveum is a 2023 first-person shooter game developed by Ascendant Studios and published by Electronic Arts. The game was released for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S on August 22, 2023. It received middling reviews from critics and sold poorly, which led to Ascendant Studios laying off almost half their staff with severance."
