From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_(upcoming_video_game)):

"Marvel's Blade is an upcoming action-adventure game developed by Arkane Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. Based on the Marvel Comics character Blade, it will feature an original narrative that draws from the character's comic book mythology, while additionally deriving from various appearances in other media. The story follows vampire hunter Eric Brooks as he attempts to stave off an invasion in Paris while struggling with his origins among both the undead and the living."
