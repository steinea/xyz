From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_in_the_Woods):

> Night in the Woods is a 2017 single-player adventure video game developed by Infinite Fall and published by Finji. Set in a world of zoomorphic humans, the story follows a young feline woman named Mae, who drops out of college and returns to her hometown to find unexpected changes, alongside Bea, a gothic crocodile woman and her childhood best friend. The game was funded via Kickstarter, where it earned over 400% of its initial US$50,000 funding goal.
