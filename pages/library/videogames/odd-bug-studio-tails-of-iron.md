From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tails_of_Iron):

"Tails of Iron is an action role-playing video game developed by Odd Bug Studio and published in 2021 by United Label. Players control an anthropomorphic rat who must kill frogs that have invaded his kingdom ... Gameplay influences include The Witcher, God of War, and Dark Souls, though Odd Bug said Tails of Iron's difficulty was influenced more by Hollow Knight than Dark Souls."
