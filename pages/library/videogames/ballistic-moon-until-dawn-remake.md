From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Until_Dawn):

"A remake for the game was announced in January 2024 and released for PlayStation 5 and Windows on October 4, 2024. It was developed by Ballistic Moon, whose founders previously worked at Supermassive and contributed to the development of the original game. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, the remake includes various graphical improvements and new musical scores composed by Mark Korven, and introduces a new, third-person, over-the-shoulder game camera, and a new type of totems named Hunger Totems. While the story remained largely the same, the remake also adds new interactions between characters, an extended prologue, and new endings. It also remixes the locations of the totems in the original game. The 'Don't Move' gameplay mechanic, which originally required players to keep their PlayStation controller as still as possible to influence the outcome of specific scenarios, was reworked for non-PlayStation platforms. In addition, a new mechanic, 'Stay Calm', was introduced for third-party peripherals that lack gyroscope functionality, ensuring players can still experience similar gameplay tension without the need for motion controls."
