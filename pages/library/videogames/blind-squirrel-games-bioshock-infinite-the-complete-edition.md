From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioShock_Infinite#Post-release):

"BioShock Infinite: The Complete Edition, bundling BioShock Infinite with Clash in the Clouds and Burial at Sea, was released on November 4, 2014. A Linux port by Virtual Programming was released on March 17, 2015. BioShock Infinite along with Burial At Sea was remastered and released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One as part of BioShock: The Collection in September 2016; the Windows version of Infinite, at this time, was considered already at par with the console version and did not receive any additional updates."
