From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorfromantik):

> Dorfromantik is a 2022 strategy/puzzle video game developed and published by Toukana Interactive. By placing hexagonal tiles of a pastoral environment to create a landscape, the player earns points and additional tiles by connecting like sides of the tiles together, closing off fields, forests, and villages, and completing quests to make areas of contiguous regions. An additional creative mode allows the player to create their own landscapes.
