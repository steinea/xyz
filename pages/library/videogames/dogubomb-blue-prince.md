From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Prince_(video_game)):

"Blue Prince is a puzzle adventure game with strategy, puzzle, and roguelike elements developed by Dogubomb and published by Raw Fury. It was released on April 10, 2025, for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S systems.

The game challenges the player to explore a mansion with ever-shifting rooms that change every day, represented by ad-hoc construction of the mansion's rooms through the drafting of randomized cards representing new rooms, with an initial goal to reach a hidden 46th room. In addition, the mansion includes lore and other mysteries that can be solved by the player, leaving puzzle threads that can extend beyond that initial goal. "
