From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII_Rebirth):

> Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is an upcoming action role-playing game developed and published by [[Square Enix]]. It is a sequel to [[Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade]] (2020) and the second in a planned trilogy of games remaking the 1997 PlayStation game Final Fantasy VII.
>
> Like its predecessor, the gameplay combines real-time action with strategic and role-playing elements. Set immediately after Remake's events, players control mercenary Cloud Strife and a party of characters principally comprising the eco-terrorist group AVALANCHE, who embark on a journey across the Planet to prevent the megacorporation Shinra from exploiting its life essence, the Lifestream, as an energy source, and defeat former elite SOLDIER Sephiroth, who seeks to unite with the Planet to achieve greater power.
>
> Rebirth entered production in November 2019 prior to Remake's release, and was announced in June 2022. All of the previous game's lead staff return in the same positions, but with Tetsuya Nomura as creative director instead of director, and Naoki Hamaguchi as director instead of co-director.
>
> Rebirth is scheduled to release for the PlayStation 5 on February 29, 2024. It has received critical acclaim from critics; with praise for its open world, variety of content, combat system, character depth, music, and presentation.
