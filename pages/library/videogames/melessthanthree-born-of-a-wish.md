From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_a_Wish):

"Death of a Wish is a 2024 video game developed by Melessthanthree, the pseudonym of independent developer Colin Horgan, and published by Syndicate Atomic. The game expands upon the setting of Horgan's previous title, Lucah: Born of a Dream, and its antagonist Christian, introduced in a DLC release The Descent. Upon release, Death of a Wish received praise by critics for its abstract visual presentation, the pace of combat, and its narrative themes relating to revenge and self-actualisation."
