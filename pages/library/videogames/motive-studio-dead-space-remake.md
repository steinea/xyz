From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Space_(2023_video_game)):

"Dead Space is a 2023 survival horror game developed by Motive Studio and published by Electronic Arts. A remake of the 2008 game of the same name developed by EA Redwood Shores, it is the first release in the Dead Space series since 2013's Dead Space 3. Like the original game, it is set on the USG Ishimura, a mining spaceship overrun by deadly monsters known as Necromorphs following the discovery of an artifact called the Marker. The player controls engineer Isaac Clarke as he navigates the spaceship and fights the Necromorphs while struggling with growing psychosis."
