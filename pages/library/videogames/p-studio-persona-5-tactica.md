From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_5_Tactica):

"Persona 5 Tactica is a 2023 tactical role-playing game developed and published by Atlus. The game is a title from the Persona series, itself a part of the larger Megami Tensei franchise. Persona 5 Tactica takes place concurrently with the events of Persona 5 (2016), depicting the Phantom Thieves of Hearts as they are transported to an alternate world overcome with war and oppression, prompting an alliance with a group of freedom fighters known as the Rebel Corps to stage a revolution against the enemies known as the Legionnaires while uncovering the truth of its mysterious origins. Gameplay encompasses standard conventions of strategy RPGs, including grid-based navigation, a weapon affinity system, and turn-based combat, while employing several staple gameplay mechanics from the series such as Persona summoning and fusion, and elemental affinities."
