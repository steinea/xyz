From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_Gaiden_Sigma_2):

"Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, stylized as Ninja Gaiden Î£2, is a 2009 action-adventure game developed by Team Ninja and published by Tecmo Koei for the PlayStation 3. It is a port of the 2008 Xbox 360 video game Ninja Gaiden II. It includes the entirety of the original story mode as well as various changes to the game's design, along with updated textures and a 720p resolution. The game changes Ninja Gaiden II in a similar, but not identical way to how Ninja Gaiden Sigma changed the original Ninja Gaiden."
