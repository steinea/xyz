From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clair_Obscur:_Expedition_33):

> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a 2025 turn-based role-playing video game developed by French studio Sandfall Interactive and published by Kepler Interactive. Taking place in a dark fantasy Belle Époque setting, the game follows the volunteers of Expedition 33 as they set out to destroy the Paintress, a being causing the yearly Gommage, which erases those at or above an ever-decreasing age. Played from a third-person perspective, the player controls a party of characters, exploring areas and engaging in combat. Coupled to its turn-based mechanics are real-time aspects such as quick time events and timed actions in combat.
