From [Official Site](https://untoldtales.games/games/the-cub/):

> The game is inspired by the classic, old-school tough SEGA games of the 90s – The Jungle Book, Aladdin, Lion King – but with modern twists and ideas. Platform parkour through the remains of humanity and a world of urban ruin peppered with references as to how humanity might one day perish. Crumbling brutalist tower blocks and abandoned genetics labs, depleted chemical mines, and overgrown battlefields – each level has a story to tell. Crack environmental puzzles that keep you guessing, and stay one step ahead of the wicked humans back from Mars that are pursuing you in a twisted apocalyptic safari hunt.

> …

> The game is set in the same world as Golf Club: Wasteland, but this isn’t a copy-paste sequel. We’re going back to the world we created using it to tell new stories from the perspective of a survivor on Earth. We’ve also written it in such a way that the story in The Cub intersects with the one in Golf Club: Wasteland and then continues on for those who wanted to know the fate of the golfer and the child.
