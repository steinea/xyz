From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flintlock:_The_Siege_of_Dawn):

"Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn is an action role-playing video game developed by A44 Games and published by Kepler Interactive. The game was released for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S on July 18, 2024. Upon release, it received mixed reviews from critics ... The team described Flintlock as 'somewhere in the middle' of God of War and Elden Ring. Combat was largely inspired by the Soulslike games, though the storytelling has a more cinematic presentation, similar to typical AAA games."
