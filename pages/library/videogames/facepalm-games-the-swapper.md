From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Swapper):

"The Swapper is a 2013 puzzle-platform game. A science fiction-themed title, the player controls a scavenger stranded aboard an abandoned research station, and discovers the strange titular device, which allows her to create clones of herself and switch her consciousness between these clones. The player uses this ability to solve various puzzles and learn about the fate of the station's researchers. The game's plot explores philosophical themes including the nature of consciousness, identity, telepathy, and the mindâ€“body problem, with two of its main characters named after famous philosophers Daniel Dennett and David Chalmers.

The Swapper was developed by Facepalm Games, an independent developer in Helsinki, Finland, and released on May 30, 2013, for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. It was ported to PlayStation and Nintendo by Curve Studios in 2014. The game was released to critical acclaim, with reviewers praising the game's visual style and atmosphere, puzzle quality, and innovative mechanics. "
