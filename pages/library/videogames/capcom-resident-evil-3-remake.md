From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_3_(2020_video_game)):

"Resident Evil 3 is a 2020 survival horror game developed and published by Capcom. It is a remake of the 1999 game Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. Players control former elite agent Jill Valentine and mercenary Carlos Oliveira as they attempt to find a vaccine and escape from a city during a zombie outbreak. The game is played from a third-person perspective and requires the player to solve puzzles and defeat monsters while being pursued by a creature called Nemesis. It was released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One in April 2020 and for Amazon Luna, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S in June 2022, with a Nintendo Switch cloud version released in November 2022. The Apple version (iOS, iPadOS, macOS) was released in March 2025."
