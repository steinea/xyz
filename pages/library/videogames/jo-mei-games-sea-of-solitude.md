From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Solitude):

"Sea of Solitude is a 2019 indie adventure video game developed by Jo-Mei Games and published by Electronic Arts. Played from a third-person perspective, the game follows a young woman named Kay as she navigates a submerged city while confronting monsters that symbolize her feelings of loneliness and mental health struggles. Gameplay combines exploration on foot and by boat with puzzle-solving, platforming, and the use of a flare mechanic to guide progression, alongside optional collectibles.

The game was conceived and written by Jo-Mei co-founder Cornelia Geppert, who drew on her personal experiences with depression and loneliness. First announced in 2015 and unveiled publicly at E3 2018, Sea of Solitude was released on July 5, 2019 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows PC. A revised version, Sea of Solitude: The Director's Cut, featuring new dialogue, voice acting, and additional features, was released for Nintendo Switch in March 2021 by Quantic Dream. Both versions of the game received mixed reviews, with critics praising its visuals, atmosphere, and exploration of mental health themes, but finding its gameplay repetitive and unchallenging."
