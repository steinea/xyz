From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_(2002_video_game)#Resident_Evil:_Origins_Collection), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_Zero#HD_Remaster):

"A high-definition (HD) version, Resident Evil HD Remaster, was released for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Windows, Xbox 360, and Xbox One in January 2015. The HD version supports 5.1 surround sound as well as a resolution of 1080p and a widescreen aspect ratio of 16:9. Although the original pre-rendered backgrounds have a 4:3 format, the developers decided against re-rendering them in 16:9 because it would allow players to see more of the environment than intended, reducing the sense of immersion and danger ... On May 26, 2015, Capcom announced that a high-definition remastered version of the game was in development, Resident Evil Zero HD Remaster. The success of the high-definition remaster of Resident Evil inspired producer Tsukasa Takenaka to provide the same treatment to that game's prequel ... Resident Evil Zero and Resident Evil became a compilation called Resident Evil: Origins Collection, which was released for the Nintendo Switch on May 21, 2019."
