From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_Gaiden_3:_Razor%27s_Edge):

"Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge is a 2012 action-adventure game developed by Team Ninja and published by Nintendo. It was released for the Wii U from November 2012 to May 2013, and subsequently released by Tecmo Koei for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in April 2013. It is an enhanced port of Ninja Gaiden 3 that includes all downloadable content from the original title, as well as additional enhancements made to improve the game. The game can be considered an equivalent to the Ninja Gaiden Sigma games, as it makes several changes to the original title."
