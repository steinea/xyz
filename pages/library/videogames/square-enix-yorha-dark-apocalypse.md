From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XIV:_Shadowbringers#Design):

> As with Stormblood, Shadowbringers features a number of guest collaborators to assist with the design. The first is [[Yoko Taro]], who wrote a scenario based on [[Nier Automata]] for this game's large-scale raids. Yoshida enjoys working with outside creators because they provide a different perspective and can challenge the development team to try new ideas. Yoko's producer Yosuke Saito suggested the collaboration near the launch of Nier: Automata in 2017. Players inundated the team with requests for Nier-themed costumes, but Yoshida wanted to wait to create a more thorough and in-depth crossover. In "YoRHa: Dark Apocalypse", the adventurer joins the Dwarven twins Anogg and Konogg to investigate an archaeological dig site swarming with machine lifeforms. They meet an android dressed in white named 2P who aids them in defeating the machines. In addition to the story, this series of raids borrows game mechanics and character models from the Nier games as well, the latter contributed by [[PlatinumGames]], the developer of Nier: Automata. As Yoko is known for deleting the player's save data at the end of his games, he jokingly threatened to delete all player and server data for [[Final Fantasy XIV Online]] at the end of the Nier crossover story. Another guest collaborator is [[Tetsuya Nomura]], who was invited to contribute character designs for the "Eden" raids, inspired by the creature from Final Fantasy VIII. He received story and lore notes but had free rein to interpret them how he wished. Yoshida considers Nomura's designs to be an "essence" of Final Fantasy and desired his work to be represented in Final Fantasy XIV.
