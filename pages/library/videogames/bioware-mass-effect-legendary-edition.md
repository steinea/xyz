From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect_Legendary_Edition):

"Mass Effect Legendary Edition is a compilation of the video games in the Mass Effect trilogy: Mass Effect (2007), Mass Effect 2 (2010), and Mass Effect 3 (2012). Developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts, the compilation was released on May 14, 2021, for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One. All three games were remastered, with visual enhancements, technical improvements, and gameplay adjustments. Mass Effect, the first game of the trilogy, received more extensive upgrades than its counterparts, specifically with regard to graphics, combat mechanics, vehicle handling, and loading times."
