From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon%27s_Dogma):

> Dragon's Dogma is a 2012 action role-playing hack and slash video game by Capcom. First released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, an enhanced version subtitled Dark Arisen was later released for Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. Set in Gransys, a high fantasy world inspired by Sicily, the player takes on the role of a human protagonist dubbed the Arisen on a quest to defeat the dragon Grigori, a being said to herald the world's end, while uncovering a deeper conspiracy along the way.
