From [Wikipedia](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2171560/Morbid_The_Lords_of_Ire/):

"Risk insanity in the gruesome slash-em-up Morbid: The Lords of Ire, with brutal combat and souls-like elements. Defeat the five Lords of Ire as you fight for your life across tortured landscapes, rending the evil Gahars of their flesh-bound forms."
