From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death%27s_Gambit):

"Death's Gambit is a side-scrolling action role-playing game developed by White Rabbit and published by Adult Swim Games. It was released for Windows and PlayStation 4 in August 2018. An expanded edition of the game titled Deathâ€™s Gambit: Afterlife released in September 2021 for Windows and Nintendo Switch, in November 2021 for PlayStation 4 and in May 2022 for Xbox One ... The primary inspiration for the gameplay of Death's Gambit was Metroidvania games. The development team also wanted to integrate systems from games and series they enjoyed playing such as Castlevania, Dark Souls, and Shadow of the Colossus. Castlevania games were also an influence for game's art direction, as well as Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP."
