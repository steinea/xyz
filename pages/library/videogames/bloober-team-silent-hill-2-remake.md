From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Hill_2_(2024_video_game)):

"Silent Hill 2 is a 2024 survival horror game developed by Bloober Team and published by Konami Digital Entertainment. It is a remake of the 2001 video game Silent Hill 2, originally developed by Team Silent, a group within Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo (KCET). It is the first major installment in the Silent Hill series since Silent Hill: Downpour (2012). Like the original game, it follows James Sunderland, a widower, who returns to the eponymous town in Maine upon receiving a letter from his deceased wife, Mary, who claims to be waiting there for him."
