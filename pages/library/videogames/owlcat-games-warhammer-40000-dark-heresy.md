From [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3710600/Warhammer_40000_Dark_Heresy/):

"Become an acolyte of the Inquisition in this grim dark, party-based, story-driven cRPG. Lead investigations, uncover grand conspiracies, master tactical combat, and wage a secret war against heresy. Make tough choices as a conduit of the God-Emperor’s will."
