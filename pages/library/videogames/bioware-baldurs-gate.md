From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_(video_game)):

"Baldur's Gate is a role-playing video game that was developed by BioWare and published in 1998 by Interplay Entertainment. It is the first game in the Baldur's Gate series and takes place in the Forgotten Realms, a high fantasy campaign setting, using a modified version of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D) 2nd edition rules. It was the first game to use the Infinity Engine for its graphics, with Interplay using the engine for other Forgotten Realms-licensed games, including the Icewind Dale series and Planescape: Torment. The game's story focuses on a player-made character who travels across the Sword Coast alongside a party of companions ... An enhanced version of the Infinity Engine was later created as part of Beamdog's remake Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition, the first new release in the franchise in nearly nine years."
