From [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2278010/Six_Ages_2_Lights_Going_Out/):

> Life after myths. Death, disaster, despair. A standalone survival-storybook combining interactive fiction and turn-based strategy. The world is ending, and your small clanâ€™s survival depends on how you manage its relationship with the remaining gods and their followers.
