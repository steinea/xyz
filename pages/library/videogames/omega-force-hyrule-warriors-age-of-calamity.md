From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyrule_Warriors:_Age_of_Calamity):

"Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity is a 2020 hack and slash game developed by Koei Tecmo's Omega Force and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. Like the original Hyrule Warriors (2014), Age of Calamity is a crossover that mixes the world and characters of Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda series with the gameplay of Koei Tecmo's Dynasty Warriors series, acting as a spin-off of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017)."
