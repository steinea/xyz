From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_(board_game)#Digital_edition):

> Root: Digital Edition was released in September 2020 by Dire Wolf on the PC, iOS and Android platforms, followed by a Nintendo Switch version in November 2021. The PC version was praised by Jason Ornleas from GamingTrend, who praised the tutorial, aesthetics, soundtrack and strategy, but criticised the quickness of the AI turns and the lack of an undo button. In their list of the best board games of 2020, Vulture named the digital version of Root as the best board game app, complimenting the animations, AI, and in-game tutorial. Theel from Polygon also recommended the Nintendo Switch adaptation, praised the addition of new modes, and concluded that it "accomplishes the unenviable task of bringing its machinations to the screen", but critiqued the lack of group dynamics.
