From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Cells#Release_and_expansions):

> A fourth paid expansion, Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania, was released on March 6, 2023. It features characters, weapons, and enemies from the Castlevania series, under license from Konami. This expansion includes a secret level inspired by Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and allows the player to play as Richter Belmont with a move set more akin to the Castlevania series. A port for PlayStation 5 was released on June 29, 2023. With the game's 35th patch due in 2024, Motion Twin and Evil Empire announced that they had stopped further creative work on Dead Cells, with Motion Twin transferring their development towards their next game, Windblown, and Evil Empire starting work on their own new title. They stated they will continue to support improving quality of life and bugs within Dead Cells.
