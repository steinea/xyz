From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_of_the_Sea):

"Sword of the Sea is an adventure video game developed and published by Giant Squid. In the game, the player assumes control of a character named Wraith, who rides on a "hoversword" to restore life to a barren wasteland. The game released on Windows and PlayStation 5 on August 19, 2025 ...

Sword of the Sea was developed by Giant Squid, the studio behind Abzû and The Pathless. The game was directed by Matt Nava, who worked as the art director of Journey, a game also set in a desert. Nava decided to return to a desert landscape for Sword of the Sea because he felt he had many ideas that were not used in Journey. As with Journey, Sword of the Sea has no dialogue, and its storytelling relies on its visuals and music. Giant Squid unveiled Sword of the Sea in May 2023,[4] and released on Windows and PlayStation 5 on August 19, 2025."
