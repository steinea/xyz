#### Abstract

"Help transform your business and innovate like the world’s top tech companies.

In INSPIRED, product thought leader Marty Cagan revealed the best practices and techniques used by the top product teams operating in the product model.

Next, EMPOWERED shared the best practices and techniques used by the top product leaders to provide their teams with the kind of environment they need to thrive in the product model.

Yet, the most common question after reading INSPIRED and EMPOWERED has been: “Yes, we want to work this way, but the way we work today is so different, and so deeply ingrained, is it even possible for a company like ours to transform to the product model?”

TRANSFORMED was written to bridge the gap between where most companies are right now and where they need to be. The leaders of these companies know they must transform to compete in an era of rapidly changing enabling technology, but most of them have never operated this way before."
