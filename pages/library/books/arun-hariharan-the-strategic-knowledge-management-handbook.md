#### Abstract

"The primary purpose of this book is to enable you to implement a strategic KM program in your business and derive business results from it. The contents of this book are relevant to any business—manufacturing or service, and also in education, not-for-profit, government, and other types of organizations.

This book is written for business leaders and executives. It is particularly addressed to CEOs and senior management to help them understand how they can use KM as a strategy to achieve their business objectives. For KM professionals, the objective of this book is to help them to implement KM with real business results.

While this book talks about various concepts related to KM, everything contained in the book is based on first-hand experience of helping the implementation of these concepts at several companies with significant business results, including some Most Admired Knowledge Enterprise (MAKE) award winners. The book largely tells its story through real examples."
