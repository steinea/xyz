#### Abstract

"The Project Management Institute (PMI®) offers a professional credential for program managers, known as the Program Management Professional (PgMP®). PMI’s professional credentialing examination development processes stand apart from other project management certification examination development practices. PMI aligns its process with certification industry best practices, such as those in the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing ...

The PgMP examination is a vital part of the activities leading to earning a professional credential, thus the PgMP examination must reflect accurately the practices of the program management professional. All the questions on the examination have been written and extensively reviewed by qualified PgMP credential holders and tracked to at least two academic references. These questions are mapped against the PgMP Examination Content Outline to ensure an appropriate number of questions are in place for a valid examination."
