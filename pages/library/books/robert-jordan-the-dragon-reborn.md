### Abstract

> "Winter has stopped the war—almost—yet men are dying, calling out for the Dragon. But where is he? Rand al’Thor has been proclaimed the Dragon Reborn. Traveling to the great fortress known as the Stone of Tear, he plans to find the sword Callandor, which can only be wielded by the Champion of Light, and discover if he truly is destined to battle The Dark One. Following Rand, Moiraine and their friends battle Darkhounds on the hunt, hoping they reach the Heart of the Stone in time for the next great test awaiting the Dragon Reborn. Since its debut in 1990, The Wheel of Time® by Robert Jordan has captivated millions of readers around the globe with its scope, originality, and compelling characters. The last six books in series were all instant #1 New York Times bestsellers, and The Eye of the World was named one of America's best-loved novels by PBS's The Great American Read."

### Annotations

"Everything spun on the wheels of chance and change" (35)

"'The Creator made the world,' he muttered, 'not I. I must live the best I can in the world the way it is'" (38)

"All of us, all of our lives, affect the lives of others, Min. As the Wheel of Time weaves us into the Pattern, the life-thread of each of us pulls and tugs at the life-threads around us. Ta'veren are the same, only much, much more so. They tug at the entire Pattern for a time, at least forcing it to shape around them. The closer you are to them, the more you are affected personally. It's said that if you were in the same room with Artur Hawkwing, you could feel the Pattern rearranging itself. I don't know how true that is, but I've read that it was. But it doesn't only work one way. Ta'veren themselves are woven to a tighter line than the rest of us, with fewer choices" (45)

"The Lord Dragon's Rebirth has loosed the bonds of certainty" (58)

"It is not comfortable being chosen by the Wheel, to be great or to be near greatness. The chosen of the Wheel can only take what comes" (85)

"Perrin, he is more strongly ta'veren than anyone since the Age of Legends. Yesterday, in this village, the Pattern... moved, shaped itself of Legends. Yesterday, in this village, the Pattern around him like clay shaped on a mold" (104)

"'No one knows anything about ta veren as strong as Rand.' For just a moment she sounded vexed at not knowing. 'Artur Hawkwing was the most strongly ta'veren of whom any writings remain. And Hawkwing was in no way as strong as Rand'" (104)

"The Pattern weaves finely around ta'veren, and others can follow the shape of those threads if they know where to look" (104)

"wolves live partly in this world, and partly in a world of dreams" (111)

"The way wolves talk to one another, the way they talk to you, is in some way connected to this world of dreams" (111)

"The One Power pulsed in him, and his stomach twisted with the Dark One's taint on saidin, wanted to empty itself" (116)

"But saidin flooded him with life, too, life and energy and awareness larded through the illness. Life without saidin was a pale copy. Anything else was a wan imitation" (116)

"The world is strange, and all things change" (128)

"'The true Dragon has been Reborn,' Verin said almost to herself, 'and so the Pattern has no room for false Dragons anymore'" (142)

"We plan, but the Wheel weaves the Pattern as it wills. Rand was not first to sound the Horn. Matrim Cauthon did that" (143)

"Sa'angreal were like angreal, allowing an Aes Sedai to channel more of the Power than she safely could unaided, but far more powerful than ang real, and rare. Ter'angreal were something different. Existing in greater numbers than either angreal or sa'angreal, though still not common, they used the One Power rather than helping to channel it, and no one truly understood them. Many would work only for someone who could channel, needing the actual channeling of the Power, while others did what they did for anyone. Where all the angreal and sa'angreal Egwene had ever heard of were small, ter'angreal could seemingly be any size. Each had apparently been made for a specific purpose by those Aes Sedai of three thousand years ago, to do a certain thing, and Aes Sedai since had died trying to learn what; died, or had the ability to channel burned out of them" (150)

"The use of the One Power was divided into the Five Powers: Earth, Air, Fire, Water, and Spirit. Different Talents required different combinations of the Five Powers" (168)

"Rosel wrote that it held secrets the world could not face, and she would not speak of them plainly. I have read this page a thousand times, trying to decipher what she meant" (209)

"Let these represent worlds that might exist if different choices had been made, if major turning points in the Pattern had gone another way" (211)

"'Very good. But the Pattern may be even more complex than that, child. The Wheel weaves our lives to make the Pattern of an Age, but the Ages themselves are woven into the Age Lace, the Great Pattern. Who can know if this is even the tenth part of the weaving, though? Some in the Age of Legends apparently believe that there were still other worlds-even harder to reach than the worlds of the Portal Stones, if that can be believed lying like this.” She drew more lines, cross-hatching the first set. For a moment she stared at them. 'The warp and the woof of the weave. Perhaps the Wheel of Time weaves a still greater Pattern from worlds.' Straightening, she dusted her hands. 'Well, that is neither here nor there. In all of these worlds, whatever their other variations, a few things are constant. One is that the Dark One is imprisoned in all of them'" (211)

"There is one Creator, who exists everywhere at once for all of these worlds. In the same way, there is only one Dark One, who also exists in all of these worlds at once. If he is freed from the prison the Creator made in one world, he is freed on all. So long as he is kept prisoner in one, he remains imprisoned on all" (211)

"There is a world that lies within each of these others, inside all of them at the same time. Or perhaps surrounding them. Writers in the Age of Legends called it Tel'aran'rhiod, 'the Unseen World.' Perhaps 'the World of Dreams' is a better translation" (212)

"Tel'aran'rhiod is not like other dreams. What happens there is real; you are actually there instead of just glimpsing it" (213)

"Light plucked her apart fiber by fiber, sliced the fibers to hairs, split the hairs to wisps of nothing. All drifted apart on the light. Forever" (234)

"The only time I have ever seen anything like it was once years when we tried to use a ter'angreal in the same room with another that may have been in some way related to it" (239)

"a Dreamer's dreams about to ver were almost always significant, and the more strongly ta'veren, the more 'almost always' became 'certainly'" (256)

"If you make a tool with no sense to it, it's wasted metal. The Pattern wouldn't make waste" (332)

"The Creator is good, Perrin. The Father of Lies is evil. The Pattern of Age, the Age Lace itself, is neither. The Pattern is what is. The Wheel of Time weaves all lives into the Pattern, all actions. A pattern that is all one color is no pattern. For the Pattern of an Age, good and ill are the warp and the woof" (332)

"He wanted to believe the Pattern was good. He wanted to believe that when men did evil things, they were going against the Pattern, distorting it. To him the Pattern was a fine and intricate creation made by a master smith. That it mixed pot metal and worse in with good steel with never a care was a cold thought" (332)

"Perhaps we will meet again before the change comes" (401)

"The strange things I see here. Are they real?' ... *What is real is not real. What is not real is real. Flesh is a dream, and dreams have flesh*" (441)

"By simple trial and error she had learned a little of the rules of Tel'aran'rhiod---even this World of Dreams, this Unseen World, had its rules, if odd ones; she was sure she did not know a tenth of them" (497)

"He spilled the dice onto the tabletop. They bounced oddly. He feltsomething---shifting. It was as if his luck had gone wild. The room seemed to be writhing around him, tugging at the dice with threads" (506)

"'It's the luck.' Mat mumbled. 'I've figured it out. The dice. My luck works best when things are... random. Like dice. Not much good for cards. No good at stones. Too much pattern. It has to be random'" (508)

"The Pattern can be torn, here" (514)

"'It is not a story, Zarine.' For a moment Perrin felt almost as hopeless as the innkeeper had sounded. 'The Wheel weaves us into the Pattern. You chose to tangle your thread with ours; it's too late to untangle it, now'" (515)

"Just because I am shielded here does not mean I am shielded in the World of Dreams. It is at least worth a try" (556)

"Prophecies are fulfilled as they are meant to be, not as we think they should be" (582)
