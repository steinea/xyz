#### Abstract

"The #1 best-selling book of all time on quality tools, *The Quality Toolbox*, has been fully revised and updated with new tools—several technology-related—making it perfect for those tasked with tackling today’s complex business challenges. Quality professionals have long relied on this comprehensive reference, but the tools can be used and applied by anyone needing to solve difficult problems and achieve quality improvement. Inside, you’ll find how-to instructions for tools that are less commonly used and some tools that have been newly created for modern-day situations.

This edition unveils several new tools, along with a new section on Quality 4.0 and suggested quality tools that can assist practitioners looking to implement Quality 4.0 concepts. Each tool description includes clear icons to tell the reader at a glance the type of tool it is and where it is used within the improvement process."
