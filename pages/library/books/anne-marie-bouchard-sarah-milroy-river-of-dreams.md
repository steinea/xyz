#### Abstract

"River of Dreams celebrates the unique ways that Impressionism was practised by artists in Quebec, offering a close look at the work of such luminaries as Clarence Gagnon, Henrietta Mabel May, James Wilson Morrice, and Marc-Aurèle de Foy Suzor-Coté. These artists documented the shoreline of the St. Lawrence and its surrounding regions, from Montréal downriver to Mont-Saint-Hilaire, Arthabaska, Québec, Beaupré, and Charlevoix.

The Quebec Impressionists were painting at a time of considerable industrial and social change in Quebec, and their choices about what to paint proved pivotal in cementing an image of the province as a site of both industry and leisure — whether in scenes of the industrial port of Montréal, or others capturing the traditional rural way of life in small villages.

Featuring a lead essay by curator Anne-Marie Bouchard; reflections on individual painters by leading artists, curators, and scholars; and more than 175 full-colour images (including reproductions of more than 100 paintings; examples of textiles, pottery, and Indigenous trade goods of the period; and archival photographs), River of Dreams is a magnificent tribute to a movement that shaped Canadian art."
