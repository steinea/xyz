#### Abstract

"In today’s environment of rapid change and constant disruption, highly-mature portfolio management practices have proven to be a vital tool to organizational success.

Portfolio managers oversee a collection of projects, programs, and other activities that are grouped together to meet strategic business objectives. The practice of portfolio management is integral to the implementation of your organization’s overall strategic plan. The Fourth Edition also contains an expanded description of portfolio management to reflect its relation to organizational project management and the organization."
