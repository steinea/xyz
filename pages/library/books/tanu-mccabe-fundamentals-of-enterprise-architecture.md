#### Abstract

"With the increasing complexity of modern cloud-based systems, an effective enterprise architecture program is more critical than ever. In this practical book, author Tanu McCabe from Capital One provides proven frameworks and practices to define an effective enterprise architecture strategy—one that will enable software and enterprise architects to create and implement great architecture strategies.

You'll learn how to create shared alignment across business and technology, embed architecture practices into processes and tooling, incorporate technology and business trends, and instill contextual understanding over siloed decision-making. Complete with examples of patterns and antipatterns, this book provides reusable templates, assessment tools, and practical advice. "
