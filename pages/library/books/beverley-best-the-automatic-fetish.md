### Abstract

> "*The Automatic Fetish* traces Marxâ€™s analysis of capital, step by step, through the material compiled posthumously as the third volume of Capital. Identifying the critique of value as the central through line of the entire work, Beverley Best elaborates a theory of movement through which the capital machine generates social forms of appearance as the inversion of its inner operating mechanisms. Neither a return to basics nor a new-fangled reconstruction, *The Automatic Fetish* eschews novelty to show once again that Marx rewards careful study."
