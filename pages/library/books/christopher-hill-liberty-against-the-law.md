### Abstract

> "In this, the last book published during his lifetime, renowned historian of the English Revolution Christopher Hill uses the literary culture of the seventeenth century to explore the immense social changes of the period as well as the expressions of liberty, the law and the hero-worship of the outlaw defiance. As well as chapters on gypsies and vagabonds, Hill analyzes class, religion and the shift away from the importance of the church after the Reformation. *Liberty against the Law* is a late classic of Hillâ€™s work and essential reading for anyone interested in the history and politics of the seventeenth-century."
