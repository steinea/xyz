### Abstract

> "Andrew Jampol-Petzinger pursues Gilles Deleuze’s significantly under-discussed interpretation of Søren Kierkegaard. He presents a view of ethics and selfhood that responds to theories of moral judgment and selfhood based on stable, substance-orientated forms of identity.

> Starting from their common rejection of these categories of moral judgement, and looking at their shared projects of ethics as fundamentally a matter of becoming who one is, Jampol-Petzinger argues for a conception of normativity that privileges ideas of growth and self-overcoming while also recognising the importance and need for values adequate to leading a liveable life."
