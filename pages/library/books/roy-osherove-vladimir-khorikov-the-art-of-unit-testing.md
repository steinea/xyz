#### Abstract

"Effective unit tests streamline your software development process and ensure you deliver consistent high-quality code every time. With practical examples in JavaScript and Node, this hands-on guide takes you from your very first unit tests all the way to comprehensive test suites, naming standards, and refactoring techniques. You’ll explore test patterns and organization, working with legacy code and even “untestable” code. The many tool-agnostic examples are presented in JavaScript and carefully designed so that they apply to code written in any language."
