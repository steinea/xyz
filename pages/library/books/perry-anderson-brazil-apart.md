### Abstract

> "What does Brazil’s lurch to the hard right under Jair Bolsonaro portend for Latin America’s most populous society, and how has it come about?

> Perry Anderson, foremost observer of the Brazilian scene in the English-speaking world, offers a matchless account of the country’s recent political upheavals: after the dashed hopes of the Cardoso years, the soaring popularity of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva; the parliamentary coup d’état against his successor, Dilma; and the sweeping election victory of Bolsonaro, backed by the Armed Forces and a youthful new right.

> Always something of a world unto itself, under the Workers’ Party, Brazil had bucked the global trend towards a tighter neoliberalism. With its lodestar, Lula, now behind bars, a weighing up of the PT’s legacy, and of the contrasting Bolsonaro regime, is urgently needed."
