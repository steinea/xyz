### Abstract

> "Written in the white heat of revolutionary Russia’s Civil War, Trotsky’s *Terrorism and Communism* is one of the most potent defenses of revolutionary dictatorship. In his provocative commentary to this new edition the philosopher Slavoj Žižek argues that Trotsky’s attack on the illusions of liberal democracy has a vital relevance today."
