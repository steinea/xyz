#### Abstract

"Programs are critical to organizations looking to achieve strategic objectives. From initiation to benefits realization, program managers and teams unite the efforts of related projects to create more benefits than the sum of their component parts.

*The Standard for Program Management* — Fifth Edition is the definitive guide for individuals and organizations seeking to enhance their program management practices. This edition identifies the eight principles that guide behavior within program management, establishing the publication as a principle-led standard.

A new program management performance domain—Collaboration—is introduced and incorporated with reorganized content for a streamlined approach to reading, understanding, and using the standard.

Offered by Project Management Institute (PMI), it serves as a powerful tool for diverse organizations, irrespective of their project delivery methods. It is an invaluable resource for portfolio, program, and project managers, as well as senior managers and stakeholders.

Approved by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), *The Standard for Program Management* — Fifth Edition closely aligns with the knowledge outlined in *A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge* (PMBOK® Guide) — Seventh Edition and other PMI standards."
