### Abstract

> "From Marxist labour process theory, to radical structuralism and postmodernism, the sheer volume and growing diversity of work placed under the umbrella of critical management studies has increased exponentially in the last 50 years, culminating in its own international conference and division in the Academy of Management, and with it recognition as a significant and hotly contested territory on the landscape of business and management.

> Mats Alvesson and Hugh Willmott are two of the founding fathers of modern critical management studies, and with this collection guide the reader through the theoretical schools that have been seminal to the critical examination of the culture, subjectivity and meanings of management studies. As well as offering the last word on critical management studies of the last century, this collection offers a selection of more recently published work that will set the agenda in the years to come."
