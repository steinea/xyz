#### Abstract

"The field of business analysis has grown in recent years and is often viewed as a critical leadership competency for projects, programs and portfolios. Business analysts—and those who perform business analysis as part of their role—help produce high-quality requirements, engage stakeholders and help drive successful outcomes.

Similar to *A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide)*, it contains both an ANSI-accredited foundational standard and body of knowledge in the same publication. It integrates seamlessly with our *Business Analysis for Practitioners: A Practice Guide* - Second Edition."
