#### Abstract

"Organizational Project Management (OPM) is the framework used to align project, program, and portfolio management practices with organizational strategy and objectives, and customizing or fitting these practices within the organization’s context, situation, or structure. This guide is aligned with *A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge* (PMBOK® Guide) – Sixth Edition and other PMI standards ...

Although useful for any organization that is seeking to better meet its strategic objectives, this guide is particularly beneficial for organizations that do not have a unified project management approach and those in the process of improving or sustaining their current project management framework. As your organization grows with the changing times and adapts to disruptive technologies, this guide will help you maintain a stable framework to stay on track with your organizational strategy."
