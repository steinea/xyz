### Abstract

> "Within these pages Mary Oliver collects twenty-six of her poems about the birds that have been such an important part of her life-hawks, hummingbirds, and herons; kingfishers, catbirds, and crows; swans, swallows and, of course, the snowy owl, among a dozen others-including ten poems that have never before been collected. She adds two beautifully crafted essays, 'Owls,' selected for the Best American Essays series, and 'Bird,' a new essay that will surely take its place among the classics of the genre. In the words of the poet Stanley Kunitz, 'Mary Oliverâ€™s poetry is fine and deep; it reads like a blessing. Her special gift is to connect us with our sources in the natural world, its beauties and terrors and mysteries and consolations.'"

"terror is naturally and abundantly part of life, part of even the most becalmed, intelligent, sunny life---as, for example, my own. The world where the owl is endlessly hungry and endlessly on the hunt is the world in which I live too. There is only one world" (16)

#### Bird

"Injured gulls are common; nature's maw receives them again implacably; almost never is a rescue justified by a return to health and freedom. And this gull was close to that deep maw" (41)
