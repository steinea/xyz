### Abstract

> "In this brilliantly enjoyable rallying-cry of a book, Kropotkin lays out the heart of his anarchist beliefsâ€”beliefs that surged around the world in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and that have a renewed relevance and poignancy today. Humane and thoughtful, but also a devastating critique of how modern society is organized (with the brutal, narrow few clinging onto their wealth and privileges at the expense of the many), *The Conquest of Bread* is a book to be argued over, again and again."
