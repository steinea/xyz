#### Abstract

"Around half of all software projects fail to deliver on requirements. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) helps make sure that yours isn’t one of them. Behavior-Driven Development in Action, Second Edition teaches you how to ensure that everyone involved in a software project—from developers to non-technical stakeholders—are in agreement on goals and objectives. It lays out the communication skills, collaborative practices, and useful automation tools that will let you seamlessly succeed with BDD. Now in its second edition, this revised bestseller has been extensively updated with new techniques for incorporating BDD into large-scale and enterprise development practices such as Agile and DevOps."
