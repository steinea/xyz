#### Abstract

"Written by the creator of SpecFlow and the author of The Cucumber for Java Book, this book gives the reader the inside information on how to effectively formulate concrete examples (generated during the discovery phase) as business-readable, Gherkin scenarios - the industry leading Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) specification syntax. This practical guide explores the practices and principles for writing better scenarios (using Given/When/Then), by following a team as they create living documentation for a product that they are enhancing.

This book is written for everyone involved in the specification and delivery of software (including product owners, business analysts, developers and testers). The book describes how all stakeholders need to be involved in the creation of a product's specification. How you get involved will depend on your skills, your other time commitments, and a host of other factors - but the involvement of all concerned is essential. So, whether you come up with the words, do the typing, or provide constructive feedback, you will find this book indispensable.

This is the second in the BDD Books series that will guide you through the entire development process, including specific technical practices needed to successfully drive development using collaboratively-authored specifications and living documentation."
