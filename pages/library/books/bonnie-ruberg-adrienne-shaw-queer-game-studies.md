### Abstract

> "Video games have developed into a rich, growing field at many top universities, but they have rarely been considered from a queer perspective. Immersion in new worlds, video games seem to offer the perfect opportunity to explore the alterity that queer culture longs for, but often sexism and discrimination in gamer culture steal the spotlight. _Queer Game Studies_ provides a welcome corrective, revealing the capacious albeit underappreciated communities that are making, playing, and studying queer games.
>
> These in-depth, diverse, and accessible essays use queerness to challenge the ideas that have dominated gaming discussions. Demonstrating the centrality of LGBTQ issues to the gamer world, they establish an alternative lens for examining this increasingly important culture. _Queer Game Studies_ covers important subjects such as the representation of queer bodies, the casual misogyny prevalent in video games, the need for greater diversity in gamer culture, and reading popular games like _Bayonetta_, _Mass Effect_, and _Metal Gear Solid_ from a queer perspective.
>
> Perfect for both everyday readers and instructors looking to add diversity to their courses, _Queer Game Studies_ is the ideal introduction to the vast and vibrant realm of queer gaming."
