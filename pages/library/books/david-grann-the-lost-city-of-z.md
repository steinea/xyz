### Abstract

> "Fawcett’s fate—and the tantalizing clues he left behind about 'Z' –became an obsession for hundreds who followed him into the uncharted wilderness. For decades scientists and adventurers have searched for evidence of Fawcett’s party and the lost City of Z. Countless have perished, been captured by tribes, or gone mad. As David Grann delved ever deeper into the mystery surrounding Fawcett’s quest, and the greater mystery of what lies within the Amazon, he found himself, like the generations who preceded him, drawn into the jungle’s "green hell." His quest for the truth, and his stunning discoveries about Fawcett’s fate and "Z," form the heart of this enthralling narrative."
