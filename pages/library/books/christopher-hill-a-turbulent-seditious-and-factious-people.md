### Abstract

> "John Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress is one of the most important works of English literature. Translated into more than 200 languages, it once rivalled the Bible in popularity in the English-speaking world.

> In *A Turbulent, Seditious and Factious People*, Christopher Hill reassesses the well-known author to recover Bunyan’s significance as a preacher—a man whose nonconformist religion led him into conflict with the Quakers and resulted in long years of imprisonment. It was while confined that he wrote his most famous works. This classic biography by one of the leading historians of the seventeenth century offers an extraordinary insight into one of Britain’s most influential writers."
