### Abstract

> "A revised, expanded and updated version of the influential, original *City of Darkness*, first published in 1993. *City of Darkness Revisited* is the most thorough record of the Kowloon Walled City, one of Hong Kong’s most notorious, and most misunderstood, neighborhoods. This updated new volume adds significant new essays, maps, drawings, photographs and interviews to the story of the Kowloon Walled City, at the time the most densely populated place on the planet: over 35,000 people squeezed into 350 buildings, 12-14 floors high, packed into a single Hong Kong city block."
