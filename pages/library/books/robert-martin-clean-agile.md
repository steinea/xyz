#### Abstract

"Martin describes what Agile is in no uncertain terms: a small discipline that helps small teams manage small projects . . . with huge implications because every big project is comprised of many small projects. Drawing on his fifty years' experience with projects of every conceivable type, he shows how Agile can help you bring true professionalism to software development."
