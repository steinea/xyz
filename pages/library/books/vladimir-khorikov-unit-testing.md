#### Abstract

"Great testing practices maximize your project quality and delivery speed by identifying bad code early in the development process. Wrong tests will break your code, multiply bugs, and increase time and costs. You owe it to yourself—and your projects—to learn how to do excellent unit testing.

Unit Testing Principles, Patterns and Practices teaches you to design and write tests that target key areas of your code including the domain model. In this clearly written guide, you learn to develop professional-quality tests and test suites and integrate testing throughout the application life cycle. As you adopt a testing mindset, you’ll be amazed at how better tests cause you to write better code."
