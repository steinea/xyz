### Abstract

From [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Snow-Image,_and_Other_Twice-Told_Tales):

> After publishing his collection _[[Mosses from an Old Manse]]_ in 1846, Hawthorne mostly turned away from the short tales that had marked the majority of his career to that point. In the interim period leading up to the collection _The Snow-Image, and Other Twice-Told Tales_, he wrote only four new stories: 'Main-street', 'Feathertop', 'The Snow-Image', and 'The Great Stone Face.' All but 'Feathertop' would be included in the new collection.
>
> In his preface to the collection, Hawthorne playfully noted that his confessional tone in writing about himself should not be trusted: '[T]hese things hide the man instead of displaying him', he wrote, and suggested that readers seeking 'essential traits' of the author 'must make quite another kind of inquest', specifically that 'you must look through the whole range of his fictitious characters, good and evil.'
