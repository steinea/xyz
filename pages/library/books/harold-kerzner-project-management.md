#### Abstract

"In the newly revised 13th Edition of *Project Management: A Systems Approach to Planning, Scheduling, and Controlling*, project management pioneer, leader, and educator Dr. Harold Kerzner delivers a comprehensive and intuitive approach to project management. Widely known as the bestselling 'bible' of project management, this book aligns with the concepts and standards outlined in PMI’s latest *A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge, (PMBOK® Guide)* and contains the detailed coverage of tools and methods used at all stages of a project.   

New content added to this 13th Edition includes project health checks, the continued growth of strategic project management, new business models, lean project management, artificial intelligence, and the use of new metrics and KPIs. Supplementary material for academic and corporate instructors, students, and practicing project managers can be found on the book’s companion website."
