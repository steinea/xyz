#### Abstract

"*Kaizen Kanban* is a guide to creating prioritized project pipelines and setting up improvement boards to maximize business success through the execution of continuous improvement projects. It introduces to the 'Faster and Better' visual facilitation approach that enables you to seamlessly leverage and combine fundamental tools in order to identify improvement opportunities for entire value streams, compile them in a prioritized project pipeline, and set up improvement display boards, or 'kaizen kanbans,' linked to key business objectives.

Kaizen kanbans follow the same principles used with traditional kanbans. They are visual communication tools and are visible to all levels of employees within the organization. The difference is that instead of telling operators what to build next or what parts to retrieve, the cards tell improvement teams what pre-approved projects are most relevant to current business needs and are next in line for implementation.

This approach is designed to complement and enhance the effectiveness of quality, lean, continuous improvement, and project management initiatives that may already be in place in an organization."
