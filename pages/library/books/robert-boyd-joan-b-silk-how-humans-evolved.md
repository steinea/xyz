### Abstract

> "The gold-standard text, with new cutting-edge genetic research
>
> How Humans Evolved has long been the #1 text for helping students understand the most exciting research in biological anthropology. In the Ninth Edition, new contributing author Kevin Langergraber makes the discipline’s newest frontier—ancient and contemporary DNA research—accessible and relevant to students. Further new coverage of important recent fossil discoveries, modern human behavior, and race ensure the text continues inspiring students to think critically about the key developments driving the field today."
