### Abstract

> "It's back again! The award-winning, Eisner nominated, highly praised debut book from Linnea Sterte (author of A Frog in the Fall). An alien desert comes to life around the body of a dying whale. Animals, insects, and ancient peoples scramble for her remains, making their homes among her bones, struggling through a millennia-long process of decay. Itâ€™s a bit like a documentary. For fans of A Frog in the Fall, Avatar, and Moebius.

> This edition contains both the full original story, and Blood Caudex, a 17-page companion piece that was added in the second edition. The 152 page book is full color and has french flaps and gold foil stamping on the cover."
