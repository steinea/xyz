#### Abstract

"Designed to provide software engineers, students, and IT professionals with an understanding of the fundamentals of project management in the technology/IT field, this book serves as a practical introduction to the subject. Updated with information on how Fundamentals of Project Management integrates with and complements Project Management Institute's Project Management Body of Knowledge, this collection explains fundamental methodologies and techniques while also discussing new technology, tools, and virtual work environments. Examples and case studies are based on technology projects, and there are sample documents ranging from initial RFP to closing reports and different meeting agendas, status reports, cost analysis, and technical specifications. The book includes 60 templates to lead technology professionals through the six phases of the project life cycle: planning, design, development, integration, deployment, and postdeployment. A chapter on using social media is also included."
