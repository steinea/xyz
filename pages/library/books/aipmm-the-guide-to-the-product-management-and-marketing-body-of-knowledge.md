#### Abstract

"Many of the leading voices in the product management profession collaborated closely with working product managers to develop *The Guide to the Product Management and Marketing Body of Knowledge* (the ProdBOKÂ® Guide). This effort was enhanced by project management, user experience, and business analyst thought leaders who further defined and optimized several essential working relationships that improve product manager effectiveness.

As a result of this groundbreaking collaboration within the product management community and across the adjoining professions, the ProdBOK Guide provides the most comprehensive view of product management and marketing as they apply to a wide range of goods and services. The resulting standard provides product managers with essential knowledge to improve the practice of product management and deliver organizational results."
