### Abstract

> "Since 2010 writer and artist Renee Gladman has placed fantastic and philosophical stories in the invented city-state of Ravicka, a Ruritanian everyplace with its own gestural language, poetic architecture, and inexplicable physics. As Ravicka has grown, so has Gladman's project, spilling out from her fiction—*Event Factory*, *The Ravickians*, and *Ana Patova Crosses a Bridge*—into her nonfiction (*Calamities*) and even visual art (*Prose Architectures*). The result is a project unlike any other in American letters today, a fictional world that spans not only multiple books but different genres, even different art forms.

> In *Houses of Ravicka*, the city's comptroller, author of *Regulating the Book of Regulations*, seems to have lost a house. It is not where it's supposed to be, though an invisible house on the far side of town, which corresponds to the missing house, remains appropriately invisible. Inside the invisible house, a nameless Ravickian considers how she came to the life she is living, and investigates the deep history of Ravicka—that mysterious city-country born of Renee Gladman's philosophical, funny, audacious, extraordinary imagination."
