### Abstract

> "Truth and Method is a landmark work of 20th century thought which established Hans Georg-Gadamer as one of the most important philosophical voices of the 20th Century. In this book, Gadamer established the field of ‘philosophical hermeneutics': exploring the nature of knowledge, the book rejected traditional quasi-scientific approaches to establishing cultural meaning that were prevalent after the war. In arguing the ‘truth' and ‘method' acted in opposition to each other, Gadamer examined the ways in which historical and cultural circumstance fundamentally influenced human understanding. It was an approach that would become hugely influential in the humanities and social sciences and remains so to this day in the work of Jurgen Habermas and many others."

### 1.1 The Significance of the Humanist Tradition for the Human Sciences

#### 1.1.1 The Problem of Method

 Human sciences = science of Geist (spirit)

 Aim of human sciences is to understand how *what is has become,* or, *how it happened that it is so.*

 Historical study (has been) grounded in *Bildung*

<br>


#### 1.1.2 The Guiding Concepts of Humanism

##### 1.1.2.1 Bildung (culture)

 Bildung = self-formation, education, or cultivation

 Bildung = *rising up to humanity through culture*

 Von Humboldt: Bildung is "something both higher and more inward
 [than Kultur], namely the disposition of mind which, from the
 knowledge and the feeling of the total intellectual and moral
 endeavour, flows harmoniously into sensibility and character"

 Bildung (German) = Formatio (Latin), Formation (English)

 Bild = form; generates *Nachbild* (image, copy) and *Vorbild* (model)

 Bildung is the result of the process of becoming. Bildung is a state
 of continual self-formation.

 In Bildung "that by which and through which one is formed becomes
 completely one's own"; "everything is preserved."

 Hegel: Bildung is "rising to the universal"

 Man's "particular being is determined in measure and proportion"

 Bildung is *a task for man.* Bildung is the work of sacrifice, because
 it requires restraining desire for the sake of the universal.

 The essence of work is *to form the thing rather than consume it.*

 *Work is restrained desire.* The "working consciousness raises itself
 above the immediacy of its existence to universality"---*by forming
 the thing it forms itself.*

 Bildung "includes overcoming the element in it [the work of
 self-sacrifice] that is alien to the particularity which is oneself,
 and making it wholly one's own"

 This work is also the character of the *historical spirit:* "to
 reconcile itself with itself, to recognize oneself in another being"

 *Bildung leads beyond what man knows and experiences immediately.*

 Bildung "consists in learning to affirm what is different from
 oneself and to find universal viewpoints from which one can grasp the
 thing, "the objective thing in its freedom," without selfish
 interest"

 *To recognize one's own in the alien ... is the basic movement of
 spirit, whose being consists only in returning to itself from what is
 other*

 Bildung is "getting beyond [one's] naturalness"

 The essence of Bildung is thus *return to oneself from alienation*

 Now:

 Bildung is the element in which the human sciences move.

 The "human sciences presuppose that the scholarly consciousness is
 already formed [gebildet, my translation] and for that very reason
 possesses the right, unlearnable, and inimitable tact that envelops
 the human sciences' form of judgment and mode of knowledge as if it
 [tact] were the element in which they [judgment and knowledge]
 move"

 Tact [aesthetic feeling] *presupposes this element of Bildung*

 For tact memory is required, but not memory as a mere piece of
 "psychological equipment"

 Memory is a part of the "historical constitution of man"---his
 history and his Bildung. Memory as technique or faculty is still
 *alienated,* it is not *absolutely [one's] own"*

 *Memory must be formed; for memory is not memory for anything and
 everything*

 Memory is "an essential element of the finite historical being of
 man"

 To *keep in mind,* to *remember,* is also to forget, or rather, to
 pass over and leave unsaid. This is the character of tact, the "tacit
 and unformulable"

 Tact in the human sciences is "a mode of knowing and a mode of
 being"

 Bildung requires this "tact" which is the *consciousness for *or
 *sense of* "distinctions and evaluations"

 So:

 The human sciences require Bildung [formation]. Bildung is work;
 work is alienation, but Bildung is always the return to oneself from
 this alienation. However, underlying this process is a particular"
 consciousness" or "sense"---*tact.*

 What is in question for the historical sciences, then, is *what has
 come into being,* because the historical sciences move in Bildung, and
 Bildung requires sensation of what is, and by this sensation is
 necessarily observed, objective, *other than.*

 Thus: the "general charcteristic of Bildung" is *keeping oneself
 open to what is other*

 Bildung "embraces a sense of proportion and distance in relation to
 itself, and hence consists in rising above itself to universality"

 *To distance oneself from oneself and from one's private purposes
 means to look at these* [self; purpose]* in the way that others see
 them*

 The particular is not *determined* by a universal; it is open to "the
 viewpoints of possible others"

 Thus:

 The cultivated consciousness (the historical consciousness moving in
 Bildung) has the character of a sense.

 *It is a universal sense.*

 Bildung itself is this "universal and common sense"

 The "science" of the human sciences can be understood "from the
 tradition of the concept of Bildung"

 To understand the tradition, Gadamer delves into the humanistic
 tradition and its resistance to modern science.

##### 1.1.2.2 Sensus Communis

 Aristotle distinguishes s*ophia* (theoretical wisdom) from *phronesis*
 (practical wisdom)

 Phronesis requires training in the sensus communis (common sense),
 "which is not nourished on the true but on the probable, the
 verisimilar"

 Sensus Communis = *the sense that founds community*

 Vico: "what gives the human will its direction is not the abstract
 universality of reason but the concrete universality represented by
 the community of a group, a people, a nation, or the whole human race.
 Hence developing this communal sense is of decisive importance for
 living"

 Sensus communis "enables one to discover what is evident
 (verisimile)"

 *Youth demands images for its imagination and for forming its memory*

 Phronesis is *directed towards the concrete situation;* it must *grasp
 the "circumstances" in their infinite variety*

 Phronesis "lies outside the rational concept of knowledge"

 Phronesis requires *subsuming what is given under the universal---that
 is, the goal the one is pursuing so that the right thing may result*

 Practicing phronesis "means that one distinguishes what should be
 done from what should not"

 Phronesis = moral attitude

 Thomas Aquinas: "sensus communis is the common root of the outer
 senses---i.e., the faculty that combines them, that makes judgements
 about what is given, a capacity that combined them, that makes
 judgments about what is given, a capacity that is given to all men"

 Vico: "sensus communis is the sense of what is right and of the
 common good that is to be found in all men; moreover, it is a sense
 that is acquired through living in the community and is determined by
 its structures and aims"

 *The moral and historical existence of humanity is decisively
 determined by the sensus communis*

 *What is decisive is the circumstances---*"human passions cannot be
 governed by the universal prescriptions of reason"

 "The mode of being of moral knowledge ... is operative"

 Sensus communis = sympathy; moral sense (contra Kantian ethics)

 Sensus communis = le bon sens

 Bergson: "while the other senses relate us to things, 'good sense'
 governs our relations with persons"

 Sensus communis or le bon sens is *a kind of genius for practical
 life*

 Oetinger: "the true basis of the sensus communis is the concept is
 the concept of vita, life"; and, sensus communis is "the vivid and
 penetrating perception of objects evident [versimile] to all human
 beings, from their immediate contact and intuition, which are
 absolutely simple"

 Nous = sense of the true = Oetinger's sensus communis

 *Communal sense is a complex of instincts*

 Instincts are not affects but "deeply rooted tendencies"

 Sense and ratio are different

 Thus, intuition = "the structure of living, organic being in which
 the whole is in each individual"

 But the German enlightenment intellectualized this concept [sensus
 communis; phronesis; le bon sens; nous; intuition] and reduced it to
 a mere corrective

<br>

##### 1.1.2.3 Judgment

 The sensus communis in 18thC Germany was "decisively characterized by
 judgment"

 But judgment, in Germany, was not "subsuming  a particular under a
 universal" but the judgment of perfection or imperfection in the
 *sensible individual*---for Kant, *taste*

 This is the *aestheticization* of judgment. Because the sensus
 communis was *equated* with judgment in Germany, and because judgment
 cannot be demonstrated from concepts (i.e. reasoned), it must be like
 unto a common *sense* (i.e. an intuition or feeling), and thus is
 reduced by Kant to taste

<br>

##### 1.1.2.4 Taste

 The original role of the sensus communis was as "an element of social
 and moral being", but because Kant's moral imperative is detached
 from the "subjective, private conditions of one's own judgment" the
 intuitive, affective, and sensible are replaced by the *rational*

 Taste was not always narrowed to the aesthetic. With Balthasar
 Gracian, the "sense of taste is able to gain the distance necessary
 for choosing and judging what is the most urgent necessity of life"

 Taste is a *spiritualization of animality,* the *capacity to rise
 above narrow interests and private predilections to the title of
 judgment*

 *Taste is not private but a social phenomenon of the first order*

 Taste:

1.  "is something like a sense"

2.  "has no knowledge of reasons"

3.  "is an intellectual faculty of differentiation"

4.  "operates in a community, but is not subservient to it"

5.  "observes measure"

6.  "has an eye to the whole"

7.  "constitutes a special way of knowing"

8.  "evaluate[s] the object" to determine "whether it is
     'fitting'"

9.  and thus: "embraces the whole realm of morality and manners"

 *All moral decisions require taste*

 *"*Taste is not the ground but the supreme consummation of moral
 judgment"---thus, in Greek and Christian moral philosophy you see
 "ethics of measure" and "ethics of the mean," which Gadamer would
 simply call "ethics of good taste"

 Kant's restriction of the "phenomenon of judgment" to the
 "beautiful (and sublime) ... shifted the more general concept of the
 experience of taste, and the activity of aesthetic judgment in law and
 morality, out of the center of philosophy"

<br>

### 1.2 The Subjectivization of Aesthetics through the Kantian Critique

#### 1.2.1 Kant's Doctrine of Taste and Genius

##### 1.2.1.1 The Transcendental Distinctness of Taste

 The *Critique of Judgment* is a "critique of critique": it asks, how
 is such judgment (i.e. taste) possible?

 "Aesthetic judgment cannot be derived and proved from a universal
 principle"

 *Taste must be ones very own*

 Kant's aesthetics/judgment of taste requires both *empirical
 non-universality* and *a priori claim to universality,* but this
 "denies taste any significance as knowledge"

 With taste nothing of the object is known; taste is "a feeling of
 pleasure connected with [the object] in the subjective
 consciousness"

 This feeling is based on the fact the *representation of the object is
 suited to our faculty of knowledge*

 It is a *free play of imagination and understanding*

 The "suitedness" of the object to its perception by the subject is
 universal and thus the *principle* of pure aesthetic judgment for Kant

<br>

##### 1.2.1.2 The Doctrine of Free and Dependent Beauty

Free beauty = naturally beautiful, beautiful in themselves

 Dependent beauty = requiring concept, representational art,
 manufactured for an ends

 One can judge from both perspectives: (freely) the thing "in itself"
 or (dependently) the contingent, conceptualized thing

 Nevertheless, Kant's "ideal arbiter of taste ... seems to be he who
 judges according to *what he has present to his senses* and not
 according to *what he has present to his thoughts*"

<br>

##### 1.2.1.3 The Doctrine of the Ideal of Beauty

 It seems Gadamer is arguing that Kant's ideal of beauty (which should
 be the greet beautiful) paradoxically appeals to something beyond
 "mere taste" in its very "non-conceptuality"

 It would appear, then, that Gadamer discusses Kant's distinction
 between free and dependent beauty, and then moves to ideal beauty, to
 show that, although Kant reduces taste to the sensible or felt, and
 the most natural to the non-conceptual, that nevertheless judgment
 here appeals to something *beyond* all of this, something not
 quantifiably *rational*

<br>

##### 1.2.1.4 The Interest Aroused by Natural and Artistic Beauty

 "The fundamental problem that motivates Kant's aesthetics is that
 the beautiful engaged our interests"

 Why?

 Kant emphasizes "the advantage of natural over artistic beauty"

 Natural beauty possesses *no significance of content, and thus
 manifests the judgment of taste in its unintellectualized purity*

 Because "in nature we find no ends in themselves and yet find beauty
 ... nature gives us a "hint" that we are in fact the ultimate end"

 "This is the significant interest of the naturally beautiful: that it
 is still able to present man with himself in respect to his morally
 determined existence"

 This is the *confirmation of man by another.*

 Gadamer agrees, but he thinks that Kant evaluated art incorrectly.

 "[C]ontrariwise, one can see that the advantage of art over natural
 beauty is that the language of art exerts its claims, and does not
 offer itself freely and indeterminately for interpretation according
 to one's mood, but speaks to us in a significant and definite way"

 This *definiteness* is not a fetter but *opens up room for play, for
 the free play of our cognitive faculties*

 The measure of significance (its *concept*) becomes "aesthetically
 expanded"

 For Kant, art is *the presentation of aesthetic ideas---*i.e., of
 something that lies beyond all concepts

 So, the "beautiful is grasped without a concept and yet at the same
 time has a binding force"

 This force is *genius*

 Genius is crucial to aesthetic rate, facilitating *the play of one's
 mental powers, *increasing *the vitality that comes from the harmony
 between imagination and understanding,* and inviting one *to linger
 before the beautiful*

<br>

##### 1.2.1.5 The Relation Between Taste and Genius

"Kant considers that taste should prevail"

 But taste = judgment and is concerned with pleasure, and genius is
 conceptual judgement and thus pleasure in the *artistically*
 beautiful, and so is just a limited version of taste

 *The critique of taste (aesthetics) is a preparation for teleology*

 Gadamer argues that Kant basically downplays art and privileges nature
 to justify teleology, but his arguments ultimately allow for an
 equating of art with nature, and thus a critique of art from
 *genius* (contingent, dependent) on the same terms of Kant's (free,
 natural) *taste*

<br>

#### 1.2.2 The Aesthetics of Genius and the Concept of Experience (Erlebnis)

##### 1.2.2.1 The Dominance of the Concept of Genius

Gadamer moves to explain the change that occurred after Kant

 "Kant's main concern ... was to give aesthetics an autonomous basis
 freed from the criterion of the concept, and not to raise the question
 of truth in the sphere of art, but to base aesthetic judgment on the
 subjective a priori of our feeling of life, the harmony of our
 capacity for 'knowledge in general,' which is the essence of both
 taste and genius"

 "All of this was of a piece with nineteenth-century irrationalism and
 the cult of genius"

 "Kant's doctrine of the 'heightening of the feeling of life'
 (Lebensgefühl) in aesthetic pleasure helped the idea of 'genius' to
 develop into a comprehensive concept of life (Leben), especially after
 Fichte had elevated genius and what genius created to a universal
 transcendental position"

 "Hence, by trying to derive all objective validity from
 transcendental subjectivity, neo-Kantianism declared the concept of
 Erlebnis to be the very stuff of consciousness"

 Essentially, Gadamer identifies the inversion of the Kantian dialectic
 of nature/art, taste/genius, and shows how Kant's successors used
 Kant in this inverted way to argue for an "all-enclosing"
 *standpoint* for art, and thus the rendering of *Erlebnis* equivalent
 with experience

<br>

##### 1.2.2.2 On the History of the Word Erlebnis

 The *verb* Erleben means "to be still alive when something happens",
 suggesting *the immediacy with which something real is grasped*

 The *form* das Erlebte is also used, meaning "the permanent content
 of what is experienced", the *yield or result that achieves
 permanence, weight, and significance from out of the transience of
 experiencing*

 The newer term *Erlebnis* is *both*

 Especially gains this meaning in relation to biographies of poets:
 "something becomes an "experience" not only insofar as it is
 experienced, but insofar as its being experienced makes a special
 impression that gives it lasting importance"

 Erlebnis was probably introduced to classical Germany by Rousseau, to
 describe the "world of inner experiences" expressed in his writing

 But Erlebnis and Erleben don't really fit this usage, but mean rather
 *what is directly given, the ultimate material for all imaginative
 creation*

 Erlebnis, then, is a *criticism of Enlightenment rationalism, which,
 following Rousseau, emphasized the concept of life (Leben):* [see
 outcome of neo-Kantian application of genius to art and formalization
 of Leben by Fichte]

 Thus, the Germans, taking up Rousseau's "Erlebnis", or rather,
 using Erlebnis to discuss Rousseau, critiqued and transformed
 Rousseau's life (in German Leben), through the Germanic associations
 of their concepts. So Rousseau's work influenced the use of Leben and
 Erlebnis in Germany, but the original content of the terms, derived
 from Kant and transformed by his successors, changed the thinking of
 those terms from how Rousseau's enlightenment rationalism originally
 employed them

 With Fichte, Hegel, Schleiermacher: "In contrast to the abstractness
 of understanding and the particularity of perception or
 representation, this concept [Erlebnis] implies a connection with
 totality, with infinity"

 *Every act, as an element of life, remains connected with the infinity
 of life that manifests itself in it. Everything finite is an
 expression, a representation of the infinite*

 Dilthey on Schleiermacher: "Each one of his experiences (Erlebnisse)
 existing by itself is a separate picture of the universe taken out of
 the explanatory context"

<br>

##### 1.2.2.3 The Concept of Erlebnis

 Dilthey's Erlebnis "contains two elements": *the* *pantheistic and
 the positivist, the experience (Erlebnis) and still more its result
 (Erlebnis)*

 Dilthey wants to legitimate the human sciences, and since they are
 concerned with life (Leben), and Erlebnis is the experience of life,
 then the *question of what is truly given* becomes central to him

 Erlebnis was brought into general usage by the hunger for experience
 caused by the alienating force of the Industrial Revolution

 The age of mechanics felt alienated from nature; human sciences felt a
 similar alienation from the world of history

 Because of the interpretive function of Erlebnis requiring givens
 (products) of experience for interpretation, art and history, the
 *spiritual creations of the past ... no longer belong self-evidently
 to the present*

 Art and history are "given up to research, they are data or givens
 (Gegebenheiten) from which part can be made present"

 Thus, Dilthey is trying to grasp "the special nature of the given in
 the human sciences"

 What is given? Uses Descartes *res cogitans* and defines experience by
 *reflexivity* and *interiority*

 This is a special mode of *being given*

 Thus, Dilthey's "primary data" for the human sciences are "unities
 of meaning": "the structure of meaning we meet in the human
 sciences, however strange and incomprehensible they may seem to us,
 can be traced back to ultimate units of what is given in
 consciousness, unities which themselves no longer contain anything
 alien, objective, or in need of interpretation"

 *These units of experience are themselves units of meaning*

 Dilthey's Erlebnis is the ultimate "unit of consciousness" and NOT
 sensation, "as was automatic in Kantianism"

 "Dilthey circumscribed the ideal of constructing knowledge from atoms
 of sensation and offers instead a more sharply defined version of the
 concept of the given"

 Dilthey "restricts the mechanistic model" of experience (i.e.
 sensation)

 *This concept of life is conceived teleologically*

 "[L]ife, for Dilthey, is productivity"

 "Since life objectifies itself in structures of meaning, all
 understanding of meaning consists in "translating the
 objectifications of life back into the spiritual life from which they
 emerged." Thus the concept of experience is the epistemological basis
 for all knowledge of the objective"

 In Husserl, the "unit of experience is not understood as a piece of
 the actual flow of experience of an "I," but as an intentional
 relation"

 *Erlebnis is primarily purely epistemological*

 "That life (Leben) manifests itself in experience (Erlebnis) means
 simply that life is the ultimate foundation"

 Erlebnis is *condensing, intensifying*

 "If something is called or considered an Erlebnis, that means it is
 rounded into the unity of a significant whole"

 Experience is *meant as a unity and thus attains a new mode of being
 one*

 "What can be called an experience constitutes itself in memory. By
 calling it such, we are referring to the lasting meaning that an
 experience has for the person who has it"

 "Experience has a definite immediacy which elided every opinion about
 its meaning"

 *Everything that is experienced is experienced by oneself, and part of
 its meaning is that it belongs to unity of this self and thus contains
 and unmistakable and irreplaceable relation to the whole of this one
 life*

 Experience *cannot be exhausted in what can be said of it or grasped
 as its meaning*

 The meaning of experience *remains fused with the whole movement of
 life and constantly accompanied it*

 *The mode of being of experience is precisely to be so determinative
 that one is never finished with it*

 Erlebnis is *unforgettable, irreplaceable*

 But: Gadamer states that this understanding of Erlebnis is itself not
 exhausted. It is more than the "ultimate datum and basis of all
 knowledge", and this "more" yields a "set of problems": *its
 [Erlebnis's] relation to inner life*

 The "far-reaching theme": *the relationship between life and
 experience*

 Two thinkers:

1.  Dilthey

2.  Husserl

 Crucial: Kant's critique of the *substantialist doctrine of the
 soul,* and the importance of the *transcendental unity of
 self-consciousness/the synthetic unity of apperception*

 Natorp (1888): Bewußtheit, the "immediacy of experience"

 Basic idea: "the concreteness of primal experience---i.e. the
 totality of consciousness---represents an undifferentiated unity,
 which is differentiated and determined by the objectivizing method of
 knowledge"

 "But consciousness means life---i.e., an indecomposable
 interrelationship"

 "Consciousness is not given as an event in time, but time as a form
 of consciousness"

 Bergson (1888): *Les données immédiates de la conscience*

 Durée: "the absolute continuity of the psychic"

 "Bergson understands this as "organization"---i.e., he defines it
 by appeal to the mode of being of living beings (être vivant), a mode
 in which every element is representative of the whole (représentatif
 du tout)"

 Schleiermacher: every experience is "an element of infinite life"

 Simmel: in experience, "the objective not only becomes an image and
 idea, as in knowing, but an element in the life process itself"

 Experience is an adventure, a venturing out into the uncertain, with a
 return to the everyday

 "Every experience is taken out of the continuity of life and at the
 same time related to the whole of one's life" 

 "Because it [experience] is itself within the whole of life, the
 whole of life is present in it too"

 *Aesthetic experience is not just one kind of experience among others,
 but represents the essence of experience per se. As the work of art as
 such is a world for itself, so also what is experienced aesthetically
 is, as an Erlebnis, removed from all connections with actuality.*

 *the power of the work of art suddenly tears the person experiencing
 it out of the context of his life, and yet relates him back to the
 whole of his existence*

 "In the experience of art is present a fullness of meaning that
 belongs not only to this particular content or object but rather
 stands for the meaningful whole of life"

 *An aesthetic Erlebnis always contains the experience of an infinite
 whole. Precisely because it does not combine with other experiences to
 make one open experiential flow, but immediately represents the whole,
 its significance is infinite*

 "The work of art is understood as the consummation of the symbolic
 representation of life, and towards this consummation every experience
 already tends"

 "Erlebniskunst (art based on experience) is art per se"

<br>

##### 1.2.2.4 The Limits of Erlebniskunst and the Rehabilitation of Allegory

 Erlebniskunst: "art comes *from* experience" but also "art that is
 intended *to be* aesthetically experienced"

 Symbol and Allegory: originally same thing

 "something whose meaning does not consist in its external appearance
 or sound but in a significance that lies beyond it"

 *One thing stands for another;* the *non-sensory is made apparent to
 the senses*

 Allegory: "belong[s] to the sphere of talk"; "logos"; "a
 rhetorical or hermeneutical figure"

 Symbol: "not limited to the sphere of the logos"; "not related by
 its meaning to another meaning"; "its own sensory existence has
 'meaning'"; is "something shown" and so "enables one to
 recognize something else"; is "produced"; "a document by means of
 which the members of a community recognize one another"

 In Neo-Platonism and Pseudo-Dionysius, the "symbolon [] acquired an
 anagogic function"

 *The allegorical procedure of interpretation and the symbolic
 procedure of knowledge are both necessary for the same reason: it is
 possible to know the divine in no other way than by starting from the
 world of the senses*

 The "concept of symbol" is *metaphysical:* symbols go "beyond the
 sensible to the divine"

 *The world of the senses is not mere nothingness and darkness but the
 outflowing and reflection of truth ... the symbol is not an
 arbitrarily chosen or created sign, but presupposes a metaphysical
 connection between visible and invisible*

 vs. Allegory: "co-ordination created by convention and dogmatic
 agreement"

 Thus:

 Symbol: *has something inherently and essentially significant*

 Allegory: *has external and artificial significance*

 *The symbol is coincidence of the sensible and the non-sensible;
 allegory, the meaningful relation of the sensible to the non-sensible*

 Genius - Victory of symbol over allegory

 Kant: symbolic vs schematic representation: symbolic is
 *non-conceptual*

 Kant uses analogyto relate the beautiful to the morally good (beauty
 is SYMBOL OF (=/-) moral good)

 Schelling: symbol (Sinnbild) (meaning image): "as concrete,
 resembling only itself, like an image, and yet as universal and full
 of meaning as a concept"

 A symbol is *the coincidence of sensible appearance and supra sensible
 meaning ... and not a subsequent co-ordination, as in the use of
 signs, but the union of two things that belong to each other*

 Symbolon: "the dividing of what is one and reuniting it again" 

 Symbols points to the *disproportion between form and essence,
 expression and content:* the finite and the infinite

 "The demotion of allegory was the dominant concern of German
 classicism": because of the fight against rationalism

 "However ambiguous and indeterminate the symbol still remains, it can
 no longer her characterized by its private relation to the concept.
 Rather, it has its own positivity as a creation of the human mind"

 *It is the perfect consonance of appearance and idea which is now ...
 emphasized in the concept of symbol, whereas dissonance is reserved
 for allegory or mythical consciousness*

 Cassirer: aesthetic vs mythical symbolism

 Aesthetic symbol equilibriates the tension between image and meaning
 (finite/infinite)

 But: **symbol-making activity [is] in fact limited by the continued
 existence of a mythical, allegorical tradition**

 *the contrast between symbol and allegory becomes relative, whereas
 the prejudice of the aesthetics of Erlebnis made it appear absolute*

 "the difference between aesthetic consciousness and mythical
 consciousness can hardly be considered absolute"

 Gadamer wants to revise the basic concepts of aesthetics, because the
 concept of *aesthetic consciousness* has been shown to be dubious, and
 thus also the *standpoint of art to which it belongs*

<br>

### 1.3 Retrieving the Question of Artistic Truth

#### 1.3.1 The Dubiousness of the Concept of Aesthetic Cultivation (Bildung)

 Gadamer inquires into the historical development of the concept of
 "aesthetic consciousness"

 Kant: "transcendental aesthetics"; taste transitions from "sensory
 pleasure to moral feeling"

 Schiller: the *transcendental idea of taste* becomes a "moral
 demand"/"imperative": "Live aesthetically!"

 Schiller drew on Fichte's "theory of impulses" to synthesize his
 thought with Kant's taste and genius as "the free play of the
 faculties of knowledge": *the play impulse was to harmonize the form
 impulse and the matter impulse. Cultivating the play impulse is the
 end of aesthetic education*

 The "art of beautiful appearance" is so contrasted with "practical
 reality"

 In Kant, aesthetics is used to reconcile the dualism of "is"
 [reality] and "ought" [ideality]. The aesthetic pleasure in nature
 that presents itself without thought of man and yet evokes pleasure in
 man indicates the givenness of reality to man and thus his moral
 responsibility to it (as discussed by Gadamer above)

 Schiller reversal, his privileging of art, opens up a new problematic
 where reality remains alien from the conscious self

 Even though Schiller aesthetics is no longer Kantian, it is,
 nevertheless, born of Kant's work (also as Gadamer demonstrated
 earlier: the kernel of the reversal after Kant already existed in
 Kant)

 Gadamer sees phenomenological criticism of nineteenth century
 psychology and epistemology as the liberator from poor concepts of
 aesthetics

 Before, the aesthetic was the experience of reality and a
 *modification of reality,* assuming that art is related to *something
 different from itself:* real being

 But Erfahrung is different

 Erfahrung *regards what it experiences as genuine truth*

 In this way, aesthetic experience "cannot be disappointed by any more
 genuine experience of reality", whereas the previous "modifications of
 the experience of reality" referred to (i.e. Erlebnis) *always*
 disappoint

 *Aesthetic consciousness includes and alienation from reality*
 (Hegel's "alienated spirit")

 But eventually, taste which obeyed a "criterion of content" and served
 to bind together society became so abstracted, so alienated, that it
 became entirely divorced from content, making possible the "pure work
 of art"

 The function that makes an experience "aesthetic" Gadamer calls
 "aesthetic differentiation"

 Taste differentiates---i.e. *selects and rejects*

 Taste becomes *aesthetic consciousness,* and aesthetic consciousness
 differentiates by *abstraction,* by *aesthetic quality as such*

 Aesthetic differentiation "distinguishes the aesthetic quality of a
 work from all the elements of content that induce us to take up a
 moral or religious stance towards it, and presents it solely by itself
 in its aesthetic being"

 *Aesthetic consciousness makes everything it values simultaneous,*
 [while] *it constitutes itself as historical at the same time*

 "the dissolution of all taste determined by content, as proper to
 aesthetic taste, is also seen explicitly in the creative work of
 artists who turn to the historical"

 Aesthetic consciousness "resist[s] denigrating any taste that
 differs from one's own "good" taste. In place of the unity of a taste
 we now have a mobile sense of quality"

 "Thus through "aesthetic differentiation" the work loses its place and
 the world to which it belongs insofar as it belongs instead to
 aesthetic consciousness"

 Society demands from its artists a *new consecration* with the
 elevation of the aesthetic consciousness above the tradition of
 religion and myth

<br>

#### 1.3.2 Critique of the Abstraction Inherent in Aesthetic Consciousness

 Gadamer considers the form of aesthetic differentiation in Bildung and
 its development

 Hamann: "perception is significant in itself"

 Gadamer notes Aristotle: "aisthesis tends toward a universal, even if
 every has has its own specific field and thus what is immediately
 given in it is not universal. But the specific sensory perception of
 something as such is an abstraction"

 So pure [psychological] perception is an ideal response to this
 stimulus as abstractly perceived

 But:

 "Even perception conceived as an adequate response to a stimulus would
 never be a mere mirroring of what is there. For it would always remain
 an understanding of something as something. All understanding-as is an
 articulation of what is there, in that it looks-away-from, looks-at,
 sees-together-as. All of this can occupy the center of an observation
 or can merely 'accompany' seeing, at its edge or in the background.
 Thus there is no doubt that, as an articulating reading of what is
 there, vision disregards much of what is there, so that for sight, it
 is simply not there anymore. So too expectations lead it to "read in"
 what is not there at all. Let us also remember the tendency to
 invariance operative within vision itself, so that as far as possible
 one always sees things in the same way."

 Aesthetic observation is not "presence-at-hand" [pure immanence]

 We must *recognize* an artwork as such before *understanding* it

 *Seeing means articulating*

 *Pure seeing and pure hearing are dogmatic abstractions that
 artificially reduce phenomena. **Perception always includes
 meaning.***

 The "unity of the work of art solely in its form" is "perverse
 formalism" and "cannot invoke the name of Kant"

 "In order to do justice to art, aesthetics must go beyond itself and
 surrender the "purity" of the aesthetic"

 It must go beyond genius, do away with the cult of genius

 "The self-knowledge of the artist remains far more down to earth
 [than bourgeois society does]. He sees possibilities of making and
 doing, and questions of "technique," where the observer seeks
 inspiration, mystery, and deeper meaning"

 Gadamer questions artistry without genius:

 "The work is finished if it answers the purpose for which it is
 intended"

 How do we judge this?

 "Does not the work's existence, then, appear to be the breaking-off of
 a creative process that actually points beyond it? Perhaps in itself
 it cannot be completed at all?"

 "it follows that it must be left to the recipient to make something of
 the work"

 "There is no criterion of appropriate reaction"

 "every encounter with the work has the rank and right of a new
 production"

 Gadamer calls this an *untenable hermeneutic nihilism*

 "genius in understanding is, in fact, of no more help than genius in
 creation"

 Georg von Lukács: "The Subject-Object Relation in Aesthetics"

 "He ascribes a Heraclitean structure to the aesthetic sphere, by which
 he means that the unity of the aesthetic object is not actually given.
 The work of art is only an empty form, a mere nodal point in the
 possible variety of aesthetic experiences (Erlebnisse), and the
 aesthetic object exists in these experiences alone. As is evident,
 absolute discontinuity---i.e., the disintegration of the unity of the
 aesthetic object into the multiplicity of experiences---is the
 necessary consequence of an aesthetics of Erlebnis."

 "Following Lukács ideas, Oskar Becker has stated outright than "in
 terms of time the work exists only in a moment (i.e., now); it is
 'now' this work and now it is this work no longer!" Actually, that is
 logical. Basing aesthetics on experience leads to an absolute series
 of points, which annihilates the unity of the work of art, the
 identity of the artist with himself, and the identity of the person
 understanding or enjoying the work of art."

 Gadamer sees Kierkegaard as the "the first to show the untenablility
 of this position"

 Thus, Gadamer sets "the task of preserving the hermeneutic continuity
 which constitutes our being, despite the discontinuity intrinsic to
 aesthetic being and aesthetic experience"

 *The pantheon of art is not a timeless present that presents itself to
 a pure aesthetic consciousness, but the act of a mind and spirit that
 has collected and gathered itself historically*

 **Our experience of the aesthetic too is a *mode of understanding***

 "Self-understanding always occurs through understanding something
 other than the self, and includes the unity and integrity of the
 other"

 "Since we meet the artwork in the world and encounter a world in the
 individual artwork, the work of art is not some alien universe into
 which we are magically transported for a time. Rather, we learn to
 understand ourselves in and through it, and this means that we sublate
 (aufheben) the discontinuity and atomism of isolated experiences in
 the continuity of our own existence. For this reason, we must adopt a
 standpoint in relation to art and the beautiful that does not pretend
 to immediacy but corresponds to the historical nature of the human
 condition. The appeal to immediacy, to the instantaneous flash of
 genius, to the significance of "experiences" (Erlebnisse), cannot
 withstand the claim of human existence to continuity and unity of
 self-understanding. The binding quality of the experience (Erfahrung)
 of art most not be disintegrated by aesthetic consciousness."

 *The experience (Erfahrung) of art is a mode of knowledge of a unique
 kind, certainly different from that sensory knowledge which provides
 science with the ultimate data from which it constructs the knowledge
 of nature, and certainly different from all moral rational knowledge,
 and indeed from all conceptual knowledge---but still knowledge, i.e.,
 conveying truth?*

 Hegel: aesthetics becomes a history of worldviews---i.e., a history of
 truth, as it is manifested in the mirror of art"; "historical
 multiplicity cannot en superseded through progress towards the one,
 true art"

 *All encounter with the language of art is an encounter with an
 unfinished event and is itself part of this event*

 Speculative idealism sought to overcome Kant's aesthetic subjectivism
 from the standpoint of infinite knowledge [i.e., the inexhaustibility
 of the "pure work of art"]; "We, instead, will have to hold firmly to
 the standpoint of finiteness"

 The question: *what is the being of self-understanding?*

 "In disclosing time as the ground hidden from self-understanding, it
 does not preach blind commitment out of nihilistic despair, but opens
 itself to a hitherto concealed experience that transcends thinking
 from the position of subjectivity, an experience that Heidegger calls
 *being"*

 "In the experience of art we see a genuine experience (Erfahrung)
 induced by the work, which does not leave him who has it unchanged,
 and we inquire into the mode of being of what is experienced in this
 way. So we hope to better understand what **kind of truth** it is that
 encounters is there"

 *understanding belongs to the encounter with the work of art itself,
 and so this belonging can be illuminated only on the basis of the*
 mode of being of the work of art itself

<br>

## 2 The Ontology of the Work of Art and its Hermeneutic Significance

### 2.1 Play as the Clue to Ontological Explanation

#### 2.1.1 The Concept of Play

 Play is the "mode of being of the work of art itself"

 Play is not serious; that is why the player plays

 Aristotle: "we play 'for the sake of recreation'"

 *In playing, all those purposive relations that determine active and
 caring existence have not simply disappeared, but are curiously
 suspended*

 "Play fulfills its purpose only if the player loses himself in play

 Seriousness is commitment to an aim; play is activity without aim;
 but, play can only be "wholly play" if one seriously commits to the
 abandon of play itself

 Play is not just an object to be perceived, but something to be lost
 within; there is no subject/object distinction

 So: *the work of art is not an object that stands over against a
 subject for itself. Instead the work of art has its true being in the
 fact that it becomes an experience that changed the person who
 experienced it*

 *Play reaches presentation through the players*

 In play there is "to-and-fro movement that is not tied to any goal
 that would bring it to an end"

 *it renews itself in constant repetition*

 "The movement of play as such has ... no substrate"

 So: *the primordial sense of playing is the medial one*

 "play is not to be understood as something a person does"; play is
 something that *goes on,* that *happens*

 Thus *play* is over the *consciousness of the player*

 "Play clearly represents an order in which the to-and-fro motion of
 play follows of itself ... without goal or purpose but also without
 effort. It happens, as it were, by itself"

 *The structure of play absorbs the player into itself, and thus frees
 him from the burden of taking the initiative, which constitutes the
 actual strain of existence. This is also seen in the spontaneous
 tendency to repetition that emerges in the player and in the constant
 self-renewal of play, which affects its form*

 **The meaning of [human] play ... is a pure self-presentation**

 The mode of being of nature is presentation (i.e. it presents itself
 by virtue of its being, its thereness): thus, "*man* too plays"
 because man is part of nature, and his play (i.e. his self-presenting)
 is fundamentally *natural*

 "the being of the work of art is connected with the medial sense of
 play"

 *Inasmuch as nature is without purpose and intention, just as it is
 without exertion, it is a constantly self-renewing play, and can
 therefore appear as a model for art*

 Play is always with "something else with which the player plays and
 which automatically responds to his move with a countermove"

 The risk inherent to the openness of the game (i.e. that it navigates
 between seriousness and frivolity and that the frivolous can
 potentially impact or even determine the serious) indicates that *all
 playing is a being-played*

 *The attraction of a game, the fascination it exerts, consists
 precisely in the fact that the game masters the players*

 **The real subject of the game ... is not the player but instead the
 game itself**

 "What holds the player in its spell, draws him into play, and keeps
 him there is the game itself"

 "The particular nature of a game lies in the rules and regulations
 that prescribe the way the field of the game is filled"

 *The playing field on which the game is played is, as it were, set by
 the nature of the game itself and is defined far more by the structure
 that determines the movement of the game from within than by what it
 comes up against---i.e., the boundaries of the open space---limiting
 movement from without*

 Characteristic of human play is that "it plays *something*"

 "That means that the structure of movement to which it submits has a
 definite quality which the player 'chooses'"

 *First, he expressly separates his playing behaviour from his other
 behaviour by* wanting *to play. But even within his readiness to play
 he makes a choice. He chooses this game rather than that.
 Correlatively, the space in which the game's movement takes place is
 not simply the open space in which one "plays oneself out," but one
 that is specially marked out and reserved for the movement of the
 game*

 **Human play requires a playing field**

 "Setting off the playing field ... sets off the sphere of play as a
 closed world, one without transition and mediation to the world of
 aims"

 "Every game presents he man who plays it with a task"

 What is the task? To be presented/for the man to present it

 *Play is really limited to presenting itself*

 Remember: "self-presentation is a universal ontological characteristic
 of nature"

 **Play is self-presentation**

 *in spending oneself on the task of the game, one is in fact playing
 oneself out. The self-presentation of the game involves the player's
 achieving, as it were, his own self-presentation by playing---i.e.,
 presenting---something*

 "Only because play is always presentation is human play able to make
 representation itself the task of a game"

 **All presentation is potentially a representation for someone**

 Representation is *directed;* this directed was is "constitutive of
 the being of art"

 Most games however are "not aimed at an audience": play is *for
 itself*

 So: "openness toward the spectator is part of the closeness of the
 play. The audience only completes what the play as such is"

 Thus, play is not a representation directed at a spectator, or a
 spectator viewing an object, but a "process that takes place 'in
 between'"

 "play draws [the player] into its dominion and fills him with its
 spirit"

 "The player experienced the game as a reality that surpasses him"

 So: when *representation* is intended---i.e. what is presented is
 *directed* at an audience---the play still "remains a game" (is a
 "world wholly closed within itself") but also "it is as if open toward
 the spectator, in whom it achieves its whole significance"

 "The way [the players] participate in the game is no longer
 determined by the fact that they are completely absorbed in it, but by
 the fact that they play their role in relation and regard to the whole
 of the play, in which not they but the audience is to become absorbed"

 "in that the play is presented for [the spectator], it becomes
 apparent that the play bears within itself a meaning to be understood
 and that can therefore be detached from the behaviour of the player"

<br>

#### 2.1.2 Transformation Into Structure and Total Mediation

 The "true consummation" of human play is in *being art*

 In being art, play is *transformed into structure,* and as structure,
 the activity of the players *consists in the appearance (Erscheinung)
 of what they are playing*

 *As such,* play is "repeatable" and "hence permanent"

 Cites Aristotle's tripartite division of human activity: *theoria*
 (thinking), *poiesis* (making), and *praxis* (doing); these each have
 an end goal, respectively, of truth, production, and action

 Gadamer lines this up with the concepts of *potentiality* and
 *actuality* from Aristotle. *Potentiality* comes from the Greek
 *dunamis.* But here Gadamer is concerned with *actuality,* which in
 Aristotle is *energeia* (n. energy, action), which is itself derived
 from *ergon* (n. deed, doing, action; labour, work, task)

 What Gadamer is getting at here is that play, in its repeatability and
 consequent permanence, has the character of *a work* (*ergon*) over
 *some* work (*energeia*): this distinction does not appear to be in
 Aristotle, but Gadamer creates it to emphasize the structural quality
 of the being of play in being art, and thus consisting in pure
 appearance

 The end of play is thus "disassociated" from any representation it
 might undertake, but is, nevertheless, linked to representation;
 representation may occur on the part of the players, but *in relation*
 to the whole, the play as such has an "absolute autonomy" from
 representation

 The player himself might seek his own *alteration,* his
 becoming-as-another, denying his "continuity with himself" to his
 audience while holding on to it for himself; in the play as the whole,
 however, whatever personal representative work the player undertakes
 (and so disguise, alteration) is caught up in the total
 *transformational change* of the play-structure: *what existed
 previously exists no longer*

 In this, *that what now exists, what represents itself in the play of
 art, is the lasting and true:* the playing, the players, the
 audience---these no longer exist, **only what they are playing,** the
 play *as such*

 Thus the action of play "exists as something that eats absolutely
 within itself"

 *The pleasure of drama ... is the joy of knowledge*

 **The transformation is a transformation into the true**

 Hold up! Let's trace some logic:

1.  The mode of being of nature is self-presentation

2.  Self-presentation is really just "being-there" or "being-as-such" or
    "presence"

3.  Man as a natural being is naturally self-presenting and this is his
    default mode

4.  This natural play is *for itself* and *in itself:* it is limited to
    presenting itself, and is therefore fundamentally *closed*

5.  But man can also *represent:* his presenting can be of something
    *not-there,* or *as-other,* or *absent*

6.  This representation thus requires an interprer to understand the
    meaning of the representation

7.  Representation is thus *directed,* or we could say, *for another,*
    contrary to self-presentation which is *for itself*

8.  But Gadamer argues that the subjectivity of representation in its
    directedness is not so in fact: "the audience only completes what
    the play is as such"

9.  Thus play *as art,* as representation, exists as a totality of
    player, play, and audience

10. This totality is a structure which is repeatable and permanent, and
    so absolutely autonomous of the subsidiary acts of playing and
    spectating

11. This totality is transformative, bring all the parts involved
    (again: player, play, audience) into a whole that is "lasting and
    true"

12. Thus, the play, though directed at an audience, still, as a whole,
    "rests absolutely within itself"

13. Because of this, the pleasure of play is "the joy of knowledge," and
    the transformation is a "transformation into the true"

14. Why is this pleasure in knowledge a transformation into the "true"?
    What is the "true"? Because representation, as the uniquely human
    act of presentation (the mode of being of nature), captures in
    itself the actuality of being, which is self-presentation, and
    which, in humans, is presentation-to and interpretation-by others

15. Presentation can always also be representation, and so our
    presentation-to and thus being-with others always consists in
    interpreting the potential meanings given by such a representation

 **In being presented in play, *what is* emerges**

 Because reality, in its natural self-presentation, is naturally *for
 itself,* reality "always stands in a horizon of desired or feared or
 ... still undecided possibilities"

 But when a "context of meaning" closes (i.e. a possibility becomes an
 actuality, or potentiality is brought into self-presentation) then
 reality is like a play/game/drama

 *where reality is understood as a play, emerges the reality of play,
 which we call the play of art*

 **The being of all play is always self-realization, sheer fulfilment,
 energeia which has *its telos within itself***

 "Thus the concept of transformation characterizes the independent and
 superior mode of being of what we call structure. From this viewpoint
 "reality" is defined as what is untransformed, and art as the raising
 up (Aufhebung) of this reality into its truth. The classical theory of
 art too, which bases all art on the idea of mimesis, *imitation,*
 obviously starts from play in the form of dancing, which is the
 representation of the divine"

 Gadamer moves to discuss imitation:

 Imitation is a cognitive act

 In imitation *the thing presented is there*

 "When a person imitates something, he allows what he knows to exist
 and to exist in the way that he knows it"

 A child dressing up intends for his representation to exist, to be
 recognized for what it "is"

 On Recognition:

 "what we experience in a work of art and what invites our attention is
 how true it is---i.e., to what extent one knows and recognizes
 something and oneself"

 *The joy of recognition is rather the joy of knowing* more *than is
 already familiar*

 "In recognition what we know emerged, as if illuminated, from all the
 contingent and variable circumstances that condition it; it is grasped
 in its essence. **It is known as something**"

 In Platonism, this is *anamnesis* (knowledge from past lives that is
 rediscovered from within)

 "The "known" enters into its true being and manifests itself as what
 it is only when it is recognized"

 Knowledge of the true: *the being of the representation is more than
 the being of the thing represented*

 *what is presented is there ... but [ ] it has also come into the
 There more authentically*

 Imitation and representation are **knowledge of the essence**

 They are "not merely a repetition" but a **bringing forth**

 This implies a spectator: "They contain in themselves an essential
 relation to everyone for whom the representation exists"

 Presentation of essence is necessarily *revelatory*

 This revelatory bringing forth of essence thus also requires
 *aphairein* (taking off/away, removing) and *synhoran* (to see
 together): the representation must be *seen together* with its
 original---i.e. recognized as its likeness---but also reduced, paired
 down, so as to heighten the bringing forth of the original's essence

 This is the "insuperable ontological difference" between thing and
 likeness

 Thus imitation has *a special cognitive function*

 Imitation, *mimesis,* was enough for the theory of art as long as the
 **cognitive significance of art went unquestioned [THIS IS GADAMER'S
 PROJECT!!]**

 Kant's aesthetics led to an impoverishment of the concept of mimesis,
 which Gadamer showed in Chapter 1. He now seeks to reclaim and restore
 the concept

 "Once the aporias of the subjective turn in aesthetics have become
 evident to us, we are forced to return to the olde tradition. If art
 is not the variety of changing experienced (Erlebnisse) whose object
 is filled subjectively with meaning like an empty mold, we must
 recognize that *"presentation" (Darstellung) is the mode of being of
 the work of art*"

 "This was prepared for by deriving the concept of presentation from
 the concept of play, for self-presentation is the true nature of
 play---and hence of the work of art also. In being played the play
 speaks to the spectator through its presentation; and it does so in
 such a way that, despite the distance between it and himself, the
 spectator belongs to play"

 **[Gadamer's] thesis, then, is that the being of art cannot be
 defined as an object of an aesthetic consciousness because, on the
 contrary, the aesthetic attitude is more than it knows of itself. It
 is a part of the *event of being that occurs in presentation,* and
 belongs essentially to play as play**

 Thus drama, and art-as-drama (as play) is the *coming-into-existence
 of the work itself;* it is "not a mere schema of rules of prescribed
 approaches within which play can freely realize itself"

 **Play is structure**

 Play must be played for it to come into existence, but it still exists
 as a "meaningful whole which can be repeatedly presented as such and
 the significance of which can be understood"

 **Structure is also play**

 Structure "achieves its full being only each time it is played"

 I (Eric) am going to call this "play-structure": both energeia, the
 working-out or doing, and ergon, the being or form that is worked out

 In drama, then, the *imitation* is "what is formed by the poet,
 represented by the actor, and recognized by the spectator"

 "What the actor plays and the spectator recognizes are the forms and
 the actions itself, as they are formed by the poet"

 This is a *double mimesis:* poet imitates in his writing, actor
 imitates in his acting

 But this double mimesis is *one:* "it is the same thing that comes
 into existence in each case"

 The "mimetic representation (Darstellung), the performance, brings
 into existence (zum Dasein) what the play itself requires"

 The double distinction, or double mimesis, is a "double
 non-distinction as the unity of the truth which ones recognizes in the
 play of art"

 Critiquing the performance or inquiring into the history is aesthetic
 differentiation, but *experiencing* the performance, the artwork is
 recognizing the truth which has been brought into existence

 Thus a scene can be on a stage or in life because the scene simply
 requires that the spectator recognize the closedness of a meaningful
 representation

 "What we have called a structure is one insofar as it presents itself
 as a meaningful whole. It does not exist in itself, nor is it
 encountered in a mediation (Vermittlung) accidental to it; rather, it
 acquires its proper being **in being mediated**"

 Structure is "not at all a question of a mere subjective variety of
 concepts, but of the work's own possibilities of being that emerge as
 the work explicated itself, as it were, in the variety of its aspects"

 Certainly there can be aesthetic reflection, Gadamer acknowledges, but
 in this reflection "the work itself is distinguished from its
 'presentation'"

 "But one fails to appreciate the obligatoriness of the work of art if
 one regards the variations possible in the presentation as free and
 arbitrary. In fact they are all subject to the supreme criterion of
 "right" representation"

 Traditions created by great artists become fused with the work, the
 play-structure, as a model for subsequent artists to interpret, along
 with the work itself, in their own representations

 "The performing arts have this special quality: that the works they
 deal with are explicitly left open to such re-creation and thus
 visibly hold the identity and continuity of the work of art open
 towards its future"

 But: "'correct presentation' (Darstellung) is a highly flexible and
 relative one"

 But more: representation is still *bound to the work* though this bond
 has no fixed criterion. We do not approve of "ad-lib effects"

 But also more: we don't approve of canonized variations as the true
 version, of fixed correctness, because these do not "do justice to the
 true binding nature of the work, which imposes itself on every
 interpreter immediately, in its own way, and does not allow him to
 make things easy for himself by imitating a model"

 So ad-lib and strict correctness both lose the truth of performance

 **The whole performance is both bound and free**

 "interpretation probably is re-creation, but this is a re-creation not
 of the creative act but of the created work, which has to be brought
 to representation in accord with the meaning the interpreter finds in
 it"

 *Here the obvious fact that the non-differentiation of the mediation
 (Vermittlung) from the work itself is the actual experience of the
 work*

 "This accords with the fact that aesthetic consciousness is generally
 able to make the aesthetic distinction between the work and its
 mediation only in a critical way---i.e., where the interpretation
 breaks down"

 **The mediation that communicates the work is, in principle, total**

 "Total mediation means that the medium as such is superseded
 (aufhebt)"

 "the performance ... does not become, as such, thematic, but the work
 presents itself through it and in it" [i.e. the *ergon* (structure)
 is presented through and in its energeia (play)]

 "the approach as such is not thematic, but neither is it true that one
 would have to abstract from the work's relations to the life world in
 order to grasp the work itself"

 "Rather, it [the work] exists within them [the work's relations to
 the life world]"

 "works stretch out of a past into the present as enduring monuments"
 but their being is not as "an object" of a "consciousness"

 Works are *contemporaneous with every age*

 The *changing aspects* of a work through time *all belong to it,* are
 all *contemporaneous (gleichzeitig) with it;* we must interpret the
 work of art in terms of time (Zeit)

<br>

#### 2.1.3 The Temporality of the Aesthetic

 The "contemporaneity and presentness of aesthetic being is generally
 called its timelessness"

 *Timelessness* is the quality of being both *historical* and
 *suprahistorical*

 The suprahistorical is *sacred time*

 But, treated in this way, the suprahistorical collapses into the
 historical and thus into time, because, following Heidegger, radical
 finitude is *the mode of being of understanding itself which is here
 revealed as temporality*

 Sacred time requires theological justification, but in human terms it
 is simply obscuring

 So a different concept of aesthetic temporality is required

 **The work of art is play**

 *its actual being cannot be detached from its presentation*

 *in this presentation the unity and identity of a structure emerge*

 "every repetition is as original as the work itself"

 The best example of this is the *festival*

 "The time experience of the festival is rather its *celebration,* a
 present time sui generis"---a festival is its present, its memory, and
 its expectation; there is no difference between these, but rather they
 are all together as a whole

 "a festival is not an identity like a historical event, but neither is
 it determined by its origin so that there was once the "real"
 festival---as distinct from the way in which it later came to be
 celebrated"

 *the nature of a festival is to be celebrated regularly*

 "An entity that exists only by always being something different is
 temporal in a more radical sense than everything that belongs to
 history. **It has its being only in becoming and return**"

 Thus we can see that the nature of the celebrant is like that of the
 spectator: **being there present (Dabeisein)**

 *true participation [is] not something active but something passive
 (pathos), namely being totally involved in and carried away by what
 one sees*

 **Being present has the character of being outside oneself; being
 outside oneself is the positive possibility of being wholly with
 something else**

 This presence is *self-forgetfulness*

 *to be a spectator consists in giving oneself in self-forgetfulness to
 what one is watching*

 Unlike with curiosity, "that which presents itself to the spectator as
 the play of art does not simply exhaust itself in momentary transport,
 but has a claim to permanence and the permanence of a claim"

 "Claim" Gadamer draws from Kiekegaard and his "dialectical theology"

 "A claim is something lasting. Its justification ... is the primary
 thing"

 "Because a claim lasts, it can be enforced at any time"

 The claim itself is "not a fixed demand" but "is rather the ground for
 such"

 "It belongs to the permanence of a claim that it is concretized in a
 demand"

 So, in theology, "the word is called on to mediate between past and
 present": "the claim of faith" began (in the past) with the
 "proclamation of the gospel" and is reinforced (in the present)
 through the "preaching" of the word

 Contemporaneity, then, "means that in its presentation this particular
 thing that presents itself to us achieves full presence, however
 remote its origin may be"

 This is a *task for consciousness and an achievement that is demanded
 of it*

 Contemporaneity is when the present and the event are "so totally []
 mediate[d] [] that the latter is experienced and taken seriously
 as present (and not something in a distant past)"

 *Being present is genuine participation in the event*

 Gadamer maintains that Kierkegaard theological concept is basically
 the same in art

 *the mediation must be thought of as total*

 Such an aesthetic event (the play-structure) is "lifted out of the
 ongoing course of the ordinary world and so much enclosed in its own
 autonomous circle of meaning that no one is prompted to seek some
 other future or reality behind it"

 *The spectator is set at an absolute distance, a distance that
 precludes practical or goal-oriented participation,* but which is also
 the *distance necessary for seeing*

 "The spectator's ecstatic self-forgetfulness corresponds to his
 continuity with himself. Precisely that in which one loses oneself as
 a spectator demands that one grasp the continuity of meaning"

 "Just as the ontological mode of aesthetic being is marked by
 parousia, absolute presence, and just as an artwork is nevertheless
 self-identical in every moment where it achieves such a presence, so
 also the absolute moment in which a spectator stands is both one of
 self-forgetfulness and of mediation with himself"

 *What rends him from himself at the same time gives him back the whole
 of his being*

 The spectator is essential to the aesthetic

<br>

#### 2.1.4 The Example of the Tragic

 "The tragic is a fundamental phenomenon, a structure of meaning that
 does not exist only, the tragic work of art in the narrower sense, but
 also in other artistic genres, especially epic"

 It [the tragic] "is also found in life"

 Some scholars like Richard Hamann and Max Scheler "see the tragic as
 something extra-aesthetic, an ethical and metaphysical phenomenon that
 enters into the sphere of aesthetic problems only from outside"

 But Gadamer goes further, or in a different direction, and argues that
 the tragic is "indeed a phenomenon basic to the aesthetic in general"

 If *the being of the aesthetic* is in *play* and *presentation,* then
 in the play and presentation of the tragic perhaps we can find its
 essence

 This essence is "certainly no[t] unchanging": from Euripides to
 Aeschylus to Shakespeare tragedy takes on very different forms

 Regardless, "the phenomenon [of the tragic] presents itself in an
 outline drawn together in a historical unity"

 Aristotle was decisive: "in defining tragedy he included its *effect*
 (Wirkung) *on the spectator*"

 Remember: *the spectator belongs essentially to the playing of the
 play*

 The spectator's distance is not "arbitrary"; it is "the essential
 relation whose ground lies in the play's unity of meaning"

 *Tragedy is the unity of a tragic course of events that is experienced
 as such. But what is experienced as a tragic course of events---even
 if it is not a play that is shown on the stage but a tragedy in
 "life"---is a closed circle of meaning that of itself resists all
 penetration and interference. What is understood as tragic must simply
 be accepted. Hence it is, in fact, a phenomenon basic to the
 "aesthetic"*

 Aristotle: representation of tragic affects *eleos* (pity) and
 *phobos* (fear) in the spectator

 Both are "events that overwhelm man and sweep him away"

 The "commiseration" (eleos) and "apprehension" (fear) of tragedy are
 "modes of ekstasis," *being outside oneself*

 "being overcome by misery and horror involves a painful division"

 "There is a disjunction from what is happening, a refusal to accept
 that rebels against the agonizing events. But the effect of the tragic
 catastrophe is precisely to dissolve this disjunction from what is. It
 effects the total liberation of the constrained heart. We are freed
 not only from the spell in which the misery and horror of the tragic
 fate had bound us, but at the same time we are free from everything
 that divides us from what is"

 So, *tragic pensiveness* "reflects a kind of affirmation, a return to
 ourselves"

 What is affirmed?

 "the excess of tragic consequences is characteristic of the essence of
 the tragic"

 The spectator's tragic pensiveness affirms the "disproportionate,
 terrible immensity of the consequences that flow from a guilty deed
 that is the realm claim made on the spectator"

 *The spectator recognizes himself and his own finiteness in the face
 of the power of fate*

 "Tragic pensiveness does not affirm the tragic course of events as
 such, or the justice of the fate that overtakes the hero but rather
 metaphysical order of being that is true for all"

 "The spectator does not hold himself aloof at the distance
 characteristic of an aesthetic consciousness enjoying the art with
 which something is represented, but rather participates in the
 communion of being present"

 *the elevation and strong emotion that seize the spectator in fact
 deepen his* continuity with himself

 The spectator encounters *his own story,* familiar to him from
 tradition, his self-continuity, which binds him to the work in its
 totality: thus, the spectator's encounter with the tragic work becomes
 a self-encounter

 So also, the "writer's free invention is the presentation of a common
 truth that is binding on the writer also"

 The spectator, the player, the writer: none of these are "swept away
 into a strange world." Instead, "it is always [their] own world, and
 [they] come[] to belong to it more fully by recognizing
 [themselves] more profoundly in it. There remains a continuity of
 meaning which links the work of art with the existing world and from
 which even the alienated consciousness of a cultured society never
 quite detaches itself"

<br>

### 2.2 Aesthetic and Hermeneutic Consequences

#### 2.2.1 The Ontological Valence of the Picture

 The "plastic arts" (sculpture, painting, architecture, etc.) seem to
 contradict the previous thesis, existing more-so in-themselves and
 thus being experienced entirely subjectively

 "We can experience every work of plastic art "immediately" as itself"

 But Gadamer wants to prove aesthetic differentiation wrong again

 The modern framed picture and its usage is "not tied to a particular
 place but offers itself entirely by itself by virtue of the frame that
 encloses it"

 "Such pictures apparently have nothing about them of the objective
 dependence on mediation that we emphasized in the case of drama and
 music"

 *aesthetic differentiation ... is simultaneous with the creation of
 museum collections*

 Gadamer is obviously disdainful of this perspective

 This is the "classical definition[]" of the "picture" and the
 "beautiful": "nothing can be taken from it and nothing added without
 destroying it"

 Gadamer wants "rid [us] of that assumption": his discussion "tries
 to find a way of understanding the mode of being of a picture that
 detaches it both from aesthetic consciousness and from the concept of
 the picture to which the modern gallery has accustomed us, and it
 tries to recuperate the concept of the "decorative," discredited by
 the aesthetics of experience

 *pictures are not just images but need space*

 Also: "We are asking in what respect the picture (Bild: also, image)
 is different from a copy (Abbild)---that is, we are raising the
 problem of the original (Ur-bild: also, ur-picture). Further, we are
 asking in what way the picture's relation to its *world* follows from
 this"

 Previously, "[p]resentation ... there seemed doubled"

 "The world that appears in the play of presentation does not stand
 like a copy next to the real world, but is that world in the
 heightened truth of its being"

 *in presentation, the presence of what is presented reaches its
 consummation*

 This is the *ontological interwovenness of original and reproduced
 being*

 Copies:

 "The essence of a copy is to have no other task but to resemble the
 original. The measure of its success is that one recognizes the
 original in the copy. This means that its nature is **to lose its own
 independent existence and serve entirely to mediate what is copied**"

 In a copy, the copies "being really does disappear"

 But take the mirror, which at first seems a mere copy. But in the
 "mirror image the entity itself appears in the image so that we have
 the thing itself in the mirror image. But **a copy must always be
 regarded in relation to the thing it means**"

 *A copy tries to be nothing but the reproduction of something and has
 its only function in identifying it*

 *A copy effaces itself in the sense that **it functions as a means**
 and, like all means, loses its function when it achieves its end*

 **The copy fulfills itself in its self-effacement**

 But with a picture, it is "the picture itself [that] is meant
 insofar as the important thing is how the thing represented is
 presented in it"

 *the presentation remains essentially connected with what is
 represented---indeed, belongs to it*

 "what is in the mirror is the image of what is represented and is
 inseparable from its presence"

 "Thus the mirror confirms the basic point that, unlike a picture, the
 intention is **the original unity and non-differentiation of
 presentation and what is represented.** It is the image of what is
 represented---**it is "its" image**, and not that of the mirror, that
 is seen in the mirror"

 "aesthetic differentiation ... distinguishes the representation as
 such from what is represented"

 Contrarily, the picture does not "cancel itself, so that what is
 depicted can exist by itself. On the contrary, **it is by affirming
 its own being that the picture enables what is depicted to exist**"

 Gadamer moves beyond the mirror image: it is "a mere
 appearance---i.e., it has no real being and is understood in its
 fleeting existence as something that depends on being reflected"

 **But the picture has its own being**

 *This **being as presentation**, as precisely that in which it is not
 the same as what is represented, gives it the positive distinction of
 being a picture as opposed to a mere reflected image*

 **presentation remains essentially tied to the original represented in
 it**

 "That the representation is a picture" isn't negative---it means the
 representation has an *autonomous reality*

 The relationship is now *two-sided:* "[t]hat the picture has its own
 reality means the reverse for what is pictured, namely that it comes
 to presentation in the representation. **It** [what is pictured]
 **presents itself there**"

 *It does not follow that it* [what is pictured] *is dependent on
 this particular presentation in order to appear. It can also present
 itself as what it is in other ways. But if it presents itself in this
 way, this is no longer any incidental event but belongs to its own
 being. Every such presentation is an ontological event and occupies
 the same ontological level as what is represented. By being presented
 it experiences, as it were, an* increase in being. *The content of the
 picture itself is ontologically defined as **an emanation of the
 original***

 "Essential to an emanation is that what emanates is an overflow"

 *What is flows from does does not thereby becomes less ... For if the
 original One is not diminished by the outflow of the many from it,
 this means that being increases*

 "[The Greek fathers] regarded the incarnation of God as a
 fundamental acknowledgment of the **worth of the visible appearance**,
 and thus they legitimated works of art"

 **Representation:**

 Footnote 59:

 Means "to make present"

 *The important thing about the legal idea of representation is that
 the* persona repraesentata *is only the person represented, and yet
 the representative, who is exercising the former's rights, is*
 dependent *on him*

 Representation is not simply "performance" but "represented presence"

 Back to main text:

 "the picture is an element of "representation" and thus has its own
 ontological valence. The picture then has an autonomy that also
 affects the original"

 *For strictly speaking, it is only through the picture (Bild) that the
 original (Urbild) becomes the original (Ur-bild: also,
 ur-picture)---e.g., it is only by being pictured that a landscape
 becomes picturesque*

 "The way the ruler, the statesman, the hero shows and presents
 himself---this is brought to presentation in the picture. What does
 this mean? Not that the person represented acquires a new, more
 authentic mode of appearance through the picture. Rather, it is the
 other way around: it is *because* the ruler, the statesman, or the
 hero must show and present himself to his followers, because he must
 represent, that the *picture* acquires its own reality"

 *Only because he thus has his being in showing himself is he
 represented in the picture. First, then, there is undoubtedly
 self-presentation, and secondly the representation in the picture of
 this self-presentation*

 **If someone's being necessarily and essentially includes showing
 himself, he no longer belongs to himself**

 "Paradoxical as it may sound, the original acquires an image only by
 being imaged, and yet the image is nothing but the appearance of the
 original"

 *the divine becomes picturable only through the word and image*

 *a picture is not a copy of a copied being, but is in **ontological
 communion** with what is copied*

 "art, as a whole and in a universal sense, **increases the
 picturability of being**"

 Feuerbach "confuse[s] creating an "image" of the divine with
 inventing gods"

 Gadamer calls this the "anthropological reversal" (which, citing Karl
 Barth, he refutes), which "arises from the same subjectivism that lies
 at the basis of modern aesthetic thought"

 **PLAY is *THE EVENT OF ART PROPER***

 "The whole of art ... is an event being"

 So also, the "picture is an event of being---in it being appears,
 meaningfully and visibly"

 "The ideality of the work of art" consists, "as with Hegel, in the
 "appearing" of the idea itself"

 **The picture contains an indissoluble connection with its world**

<br>

#### 2.2.2 The Ontological Foundation of the Occasional and the Decorative

 Occasionality:

 "meaning and contents are determined by the occasion for which they
 are intended, so that they contain more than they would without this
 occasion"

 "occasionality belongs to the work's own **claim** and is not
 something forced on it by its interpreter"

 Remember *claim*, à la Kierkegaard: Gadamer's logic is that

1.  The event of art has a *claim to permanence*

2.  A claim is lasting because it can be *enforced at any time;* a claim
    is the *ground* for a demand

3.  A theological claim begins with a *proclamation* and is reinforced
    with *preaching;* an aesthetic claim similarly begins with a
    proclamatory event (its *presentation as a work of art*) and so it
    persists *as such,* demanding to be seen as a presentation of being,
    not just an object for the aesthetic consciousness

4.  So part of the *event of art* is its *contemporaneity:* "in its
    presentation this particular thing that presents itself to us
    achieves full presence, however remote its origin may be"

5.  The claim of the event of art demands that we recognize the
    *outflowing of being that is presented to us, and so also our finite
    particularity in it*

 Complementary to the *contemporaneity* of the work of art, then, is
 its *occasionality:* the work of art is drawn into our present by its
 contemporaneity, and we are drawn into the work of art's present by it
 occasionality

 "Occasionality in the sense intended clearly lies in what the work
 itself claims to mean, in contradistinction from whatever is
 discovered in it or can be deduced from it that goes against this
 claim" (145)

 "A portrait really *is* a portrait, and does not become one just
 through and for those who recognize the person portrayed" (146)

 "there resides in the picture an undetermined but still fundamentally
 determinable reference to something, which constitutes its
 significance. This occasionality belongs essentially to the import of
 the "picture," regardless of whether one knows what it refers to"
 (146)

 Thus Gadamer argues that occasionality is not the task of the
 historicist seeking data and context to define the work, but is
 instead a part of the being of the work itself:

 *A work of art belongs so closely to what it is related to that it
 enriches the being of that as if through a new event of being* (147)

 Representation in art is not "incidental and remote" to the being of
 the thing; "they are presentations of the essence itself" (147)

 These presentations (various art-works) "represent particular cases"
 of a "general relationship" between the "continued determination of
 [a work's] meaning" and the "'occasion' of its
 coming-to-presentation" (147)

 **Every performance is an event** (147)

 On the stage especially, "the work itself is what 'takes place'" and
 "comes into its own" (147)

 *the occasion of the performance makes it speak and brings out what is
 in it* (147)

 "specifically occasional art forms ... are fundamentally forms of the
 universal occasionality characteristic of the work of art inasmuch as
 it determines itself anew from occasion to occasion" (148)

 The "uniqueness" of an occasional art form "comes to participate in a
 universality that makes it capable of yet further fulfillment"---"the
 work's unique relation to the occasion can never be finally
 determined"---the work is "independent of its unique relation to the
 original" because it is not *finally determined* by the relation,
 while it still "contained the latter [the original] even in
 transcending it" (148)

 **Every picture is an increase of being and is essentially definable
 as representation, as coming-to-presentation** (148)

 A work of art "not only recalls something whose meaning is already
 familiar, but it can also say something of its own, and thus it
 becomes independent of the prior knowledge that it conveys" (149)

 *an image is a manifestation of what it represents---even if it brings
 it to appearance through its autonomous expressive power* (149)

 *Even an individual portrait, if it is a work of art, shares in the
 mysterious radiation of being that flows from the being of what is
 represented, what comes to presence there* (149)

 In Velazquez's *The Surrender of Breda,* the being of the original
 event *comes to presence* in the painting, because the event has a
 "pictorial quality" (i.e. its mode of being, as with all nature, is
 *self-presentation*) and is "performed like a sacrament"; the ceremony
 "need[s] to be" and "[is] suitable for being depicted" (149)

 The ceremony's "being is ... consummated in being represented in a
 picture" (149)

 The sacred is that which is meant to be presented; thus, similarly,
 the profane is that which should *not* be presented. In art, this
 means that the *artistic* is that which is suitable for presentation,
 that which finds its being in presentation, and the *non-artistic*
 that which is reduced to an object of aesthetic differentiation. A
 work of art presented in a museum has been *profaned* in this very way

 "Ultimately every work of art has something about it that protests
 against profanation" (150)

 *All these considerations justify characterizing the mode of being of
 art in general in terms of* presentation *(Darstellung); this
 includes* play *(Spiel) and* picture *(Bild),* communion *(Kommunion),
 and* representation *(Repräsentation). The work of art is conceived as
 an event of being (Seinsvorgang), and the abstraction performed by
 aesthetic differentiation is dissolved* (151)

 **A picture is an event of presentation** (151)

 *Its being related to the original is so far from lessening its
 ontological autonomy that, on the contrary, I had to speak, in regard
 to the picture, of an increase of being. Using religious concepts thus
 proved appropriate* (151)

 Gadamer moves on:

 There is a difference between artistic presentation and symbolic
 presentation

 "Not all forms of "representation" have the character of "art"" (151)

 So, "we need to examine the nature of indicating" (151)

 The picture is in between "two extremes": "*pure indication*
 (Verweisung: also, reference), which is the essence of the sign, and
 *pure substitution* (Vertreten), which is the essence of the symbol"
 (151)

 "a picture is not a *sign* (Zeichen). For a sign is nothing but what
 its function requires; and that is to point away from itself" (152)

 "There is something schematic and abstract about [signs], because
 they point not to themselves but to what is not present" (152)

 Contrariwise, "a picture points to what it represents only through its
 own content. By concentrating on it, we to come into contact with what
 is represented" (152)

 Thus: the picture is not a sign because it "does not disappear in
 pointing to something else but, in its own being, shares in what it
 represents" (153)

 Now, this "ontological sharing" is true of a symbol (153)

 "a symbol manifests the presence of someone that really is present"
 (153)

 "Hence what is symbolized is undoubtedly in need of representation,
 inasmuch as it is itself non-sensible, infinite, and unrepresentable,
 but also capable of it. It is only because what is symbolized is
 present itself that it can be parent in the symbol" (e.g. a crucifix,
 flag, or uniform)

 "A symbol not only points to something; it represents it by taking its
 place" (153)

 This means "to make something present that is not present" (153)

 Thus a symbol "so fully take[s] the place of what is revered that
 the latter is present in them" (153)

 So, representation is shared by pictures and symbols (154)

 But: "symbols function as substitutes; but of themselves they say
 nothing about what they symbolize. One must be familiar with them in
 the same way as one must be familiar with a sign, if one is to
 understand what they refer to" (154)

 Symbols *do not mean an increase in being for what is represented*
 (154)

 "The picture also represents, but through itself, through the
 increment of meaning that it brings. But this means that in it what is
 represented---the "original"---is there more fully, more genuinely,
 just as it truly is" (154)

 *Hence a picture is situated halfway between a sign and a symbol*
 (154)

 A picture's representing is "neither a pure pointing-to-something nor
 a pure taking-the-place-of-something" (154)

 Signs and symbols "acquire their signifying function" from their
 *institution,* not from their content (like a picture) (154)

 A picture has no institution (154)

 Signs "function as signs only when they are taken as signs. But they
 are taken as signs only because the linkage between the sign and the
 signified has previously been established." This is *institution*
 (154)

 "the sign is established by convention" (154)

 *a work of art ... does not owe its real meaning to such an act of
 institution ... it is already a structure with a signifying function
 of its own* (155)

 Works of art "lay claim to their place, and even if they are displaced
 ... the trace of their original purpose cannot be effaced" (155)

 *It* [the work's original purpose] *is part of their being because
 their being is presentation* (155)

 With this in mind, Gadamer states that "certain forms of art become
 central ... namely all those whose own content points beyond them to
 the whole of a context determined by them and form them" (155)

 The greatest of these: *architecture* (155)

 Architecture "extends beyond itself in two ways": "by the aim it is to
 serve" and "by the place it is to take up" (155)

 A successful building is that which "perfectly fulfills its purpose"
 and that's "construction has added something new to the spatial
 dimensions of a town or landscape" (157)

 Thus it is "a true increase of being: it is a work of art" (156)

 "If a building is a work of art, then it is not only the artistic
 solution to a building problem posed by the contexts of purpose and
 life to which it originally belongs, but somehow preserves them" (156)

 *Something in it points back to the original* (156)

 *A building is never only a piece of art* (156)

 "Its purpose, through which it belongs in the context of life, cannot
 be separated from it without its losing some of its reality" (156)

 *The "work of art in itself" proves to be pure abstraction* (156)

 "Works of architecture do not stand motionless on the shore of the
 stream of history, but are borne along by it" (156)

 Architecture demands that we "mediate in a new and better way between
 the past and the present" (156)

 Thus architecture highlights for us the "special importance" of the
 "mediation without which a work of art has no real "presence"" (156)

 *Architecture gives shape to space* (157)

 "Space is what surrounds everything that exists in space. That is why
 architecture embraces all the other forms of representation ... By
 embracing all the arts, it asserts its own perspective everywhere"
 (157)

 **That perspective is *decoration ***(157)

 The perspective of decoration brings to art "a question ... of obeying
 the space-creating potentiality of the work itself, which has to adapt
 to what is given as well as to create its own conditions" (157)

 Architecture involves "a twofold mediation": "as the art which creates
 shape, it both [1] shapes it and [2] leaves it free"; architecture
 "not only [1] embraces all decorative shaping of space" but is
 "[2] itself decorative in nature" (157)

 Again, this "two-sided mediation": "to draw the viewer's attention to
 itself" and "to redirect it away from itself to the greater whole of
 the life context which it accompanies" (157)

 *architecture explodes that prejudice of the aesthetic consciousness
 according to which the actual work of art is what is outside all space
 and all time, the object of an aesthetic experience* (157)

 The concept of decoration "needs to be grounded in the ontological
 structure of representation, which we have shown to be the mode of
 being of the work of art" (157)

 *Ornament or decoration is determined by its relation to what it
 decorates, to what carries it. It had no aesthetic import of its own
 that is thereafter limited by its relation to what it is decorating*
 (159)

 "Ornament is not primarily something by itself that is then applied to
 something else but belongs to the self-presentation of its wearer.
 Ornament too belongs to presentation. But presentation is an event of
 being: it is representation ... An ornament ...set up in a chosen
 place [is] representative" (159)

 In summary:

 "what we mean by "representation" is ... a universal ontological
 structural element of the aesthetic, an event of being---not an
 experiential event that occurs at the moment of artistic creation and
 is merely repeated each time in the mind of the viewer" (159)

 **The specific mode of the work of art's presence is the
 coming-to-presentation of being** (159)

<br>

#### 2.2.3 The Borderline Position of Literature

 Does this apply to literature?

 From the regular (i.e. aesthetically differentiating) consciousness,
 literature does not seem to have "any presentation that could an
 ontological valence of its own. Reading is a purely interior mental
 process" (159)

 The "occasional" and the "contingent" that belong to the being of the
 work of art do not have a place in silent reading (159)

 "The only condition to which literature is subject is being handed
 down in language and taken up in reading" (159)

 Literature seems "alienated from its ontological valence" (158-159)

 But Gadamer argues that this "conception ... ultimately
 originate[s] in a back-projection performed by the alienated
 cultured consciousness" (160)

 *Reading with understanding is always a kind of reproduction,
 performance, and interpretation* (160)

 "Meaning and the understanding of it are so closely connected with the
 corporeality of language that understanding always involves an inner
 speaking as well" (160)

 The *reading of a book* is *an event in which the content comes to
 presentation* (160)

 Thus, like play and performance, "being read belong to literature by
 its nature. They are strages of what is generally called
 "reproduction" but which in fact is the *original* mode of being of
 all performing arts, and that mode of being has proved exemplary for
 defining the mode of being of all art" (160-161)

 *Literature does not exist as the dead remnant of an alienated being,
 left over for a later time as simultaneous with its experiential
 reality. Literature is a function of being intellectually preserved
 and handed down, and therefore brings its hidden history into every
 age* (161)

 "works that belong to world literature remain eloquent although the
 world to which they speak is quite different" (161)

 "the historical mode of being of literature is what makes it possible
 for something to belong to world literature" (161)

 **All written texts share in the mode of being of literature** (162)

 "all scholarly research takes the form of literature insofar as it is
 essentially bound to language" (162)

 *Literature in the broadest sense is bounded only by what can be said,
 for everything that can be said can be written* (162)

 "literary art has in common with all other texts the fact that it
 speaks to us in terms of the significance of its contents" (162)

 Understanding is concerned with "what it [literature] says to us"
 and not with "its formal achievement" (162)

 "the essential difference between these various "languages" [poetry,
 prose, history, etc.] obviously lies elsewhere: namely in the
 distinction between the claims to truth that each makes" (162)

 The "community" of all literary forms is language, which "makes the
 contents [of each] meaningful" (162)

 Literature is **"everything passed down in writing"** (163)

 "The mode of being of a text has something unique and incomparable
 about it. It presents a specific problem of translation to the
 understanding. Nothing is so strange, and at the same time so
 demanding, as the written word" (163)

 "The written word and what partakes of it---literature---is the
 intelligibility of mind transferred to the most alien medium. Nothing
 is so purely the trace of the mind as writing, but nothing is so
 dependent on the understanding mind either. In deciphering and
 interpreting it, a miracle takes place: the transformation of
 something alien and dead into total contemporaneity and familiarity"
 (163)

 *a written tradition, once deciphered and read, is to such an extent
 pure mind that it speaks to us as if in the present* (163)

 "the capacity to read, to understand what is written, is like a secret
 art, even a magic that frees and binds us. It it time and space seem
 to be superseded. People who can read what has been handed down in
 writing **produce and achieve the sheer presence of the past**" (163)

 **the concept of literature is as broad as possible** (163)

 "it is universally true of texts that only in the process of
 understanding them is the dead trace of meaning transformed back into
 living meaning" (163)

 The "work of art" is "actualized" in presentation; literary works are
 "actualized" in reading. Gadamer asks if this means that "the meaning
 of all texts [are] actualized only when they are understood"? (163)

 *does being understood belong (gehört) to the meaning of a text just
 as being heard (Zu-Gehör-Bringen) belongs to the meaning of music?*

<br>

#### 2.2.4 Reconstruction and Integration as Hermeneutic Tasks

*The art of understanding texts is hermeneutics* (164)

 Hermeneutics must "be understood in so comprehensive a sense as to
 embrace the whole sphere of art and its complex of questions. Every
 work of art, not only literature, must be understood like any other
 text that requires understanding, and this kind of understanding has
 to be acquired" (164)

 **AESTHETICS HAS TO BE ABSORBED INTO HERMENEUTICS** (164)

 *Understanding must be conceived as a part of the event in which
 meaning occurs, the event in which the meaning of all
 statements---those of art and all other kinds of tradition---is formed
 and actualized* (164)

 "everything that is no longer immediately situated in a world ... is
 estranged from its original meaning and depends on the unlocking amd
 mediating spirit" (164)

 Schleiermacher and Hegel use two methods: **reconstruction** and
 **integration** (165)

 Schleiermacher "is wholly concerned to reconstruct the work, in the
 understanding, as originally constituted" (165)

 His hermeneutics "endeavors to rediscover the nodal point in the
 artist's mind that will render the significance of his work fully
 intelligible" (166)

 This is **futile** (167)

 Hegel grasps this futility: "The search for the occasional
 circumstances that would fill out the significance of works of art
 cannot succeed in reconstructing them. They remain fruit torn from the
 tree" (167)

 For Hegel, it is the person of the picker and giver, who has taken the
 fruit (the art) and offers it, and not the past and the tree, that is
 truly significant: the "spirit" which gives us a work "is the
 *interiorizing recollection*" (Er-innerung) of the still
 *externalized* spirit manifest in them" (168)

 For Hegel, "philosophy, the historical self-penetration of spirit,
 [] carries out the hermeneutical task" (168)

 Historical consciousness must be a "**thinking relation to the past"**
 (168)

 *the historical spirit consists not in the restoration of the past but
 in* thoughtful mediation with contemporary life (168)

# Part Two: The Extension of the Question of Truth to Understanding in the Human Sciences

## 3 Historical Preparation

### 3.1 The Questionableness of Romantic Hermeneutics and its Application to the Study of History

#### 3.1.1 The Change in Hermeneutics from the Enlightenment to Romanticism

##### 3.1.1.1 The Prehistory of Romantic Hermeneutics

 Hermeneutics developed along two paths: theological and philological
 (181)

 Theological: "defense of their own understanding of Scripture" (181)

 Philological: "to revive classical literature" (182)

 "Both involve a rediscovery" (182)

 With both, "meaning had become alien and inaccessible" (182)

 "through Luther and Melanchthon the humanistic tradition was united
 with the reform" (182). So these two paths converge

 Luther: *sui ipsius interpres* (scripture clarifies itself) and
 *sensus literalis* (literal sense) [contra allegorical]

 But sometimes the literal sense is hard to understand, i.e., it's not
 "univocally intelligible" (182).

 "the whole of Scripture guides the understanding of individual
 passages: and again this whole can be reached only through the
 cumulative understanding of individual passages" (182)

 Luther again (Gadamer's epigram): *Qui non intelligit res, non potest
 ex verbis sensum elicere*

 This is *caput* and *membra*, head and limbs (183)

 Dilthey: "Hermeneutics had to rid itself one day of all its dogmatic
 limitations and become free to be itself ... 'liberation of
 interpretation from dogma'" (183)

 So: "there is no longer any difference between interpreting sacred or
 secular writing, and since there is therefore only *one* hermeneutics,
 this hermeneutics has ultimately not only the propaedeutic function of
 all historical research---as the art of the correct interpretation of
 literary sources---but involves the whole business of historical
 research itself (184)

 *World history is, as it were, the great dark book, the collected work
 of the human spirit, written in the languages of the past, whose texts
 it is our task to understand* (184)

 **Historical research conceives itself on the model of philology**
 (184)

 Dilthey: "hermeneutics comes into its own only when it ceases serving
 a dogmatic purpose ... and begins functioning as a historical
 organon" (184)

 "now understanding as such becomes a problem. The universality of this
 problem shows that understanding has become a task in a new sense, and
 hence theoretical reflection acquires a new significance" (185)

 "hermeneutics was determined by [] content" (185)

 "this was the self-evident unity of classical and Christian
 literature" (185)

 Schleiermacher: "*no longer* seeks the unity of hermeneutics in the
 *unity of the content of tradition* to which understanding is applied,
 but rather he seeks it, apart from any particular content, in the
 unity of a procedure that is not differentiated even by the way the
 ideas are transmitted" (185)

 "The effort to understand is needed wherever there is no immediate
 understanding---i.e., whenever the possibility of misunderstanding has
 to be reckoned with" (186)

 Schleiermacher's "universal hermeneutics starts from this": **the
 experience of the alien and the possibility of misunderstanding is
 universal ... alienation is inextricably given with the individuality
 of the thou** (186)

 Gadamer begins with a different proposition which Schleiermacher did
 not consider and which disappeared from the "sphere of hermeneutics":

 **to understand means to come to an understanding with each other**

 **understanding is primarily agreement**

 *people usually understand (verstehen) each other immediately, or they
 make themselves understood (verständigen sich) with a view toward
 reaching agreement (Einverständnis). Coming to an understanding
 (Verständigung), then, is always coming to an understanding about
 something. Understanding each other (sich verstehen) is always
 understanding each other with respect to something. From language we
 learn that the subject matter (Sache [; Latin,* res*]) is not merely
 an arbitrary object of discussion, independent of the process of
 mutual understanding (Sichver-stehen), but rather is the path and goal
 of mutual understanding itself* (187)

 "Where misunderstandings have arisen or where an expression of opinion
 alienates us because it is unintelligible, there natural life in the
 subject matter intended is impeded in such a way that the meaning is
 given as the opinion of another, the opinion of the Thou or of the
 text, or in general as a fixed datum" (187)

 "The real problem of understanding obviously arises when, in the
 endeavor to understand the content of what is said, the reflective
 question arises: how did he come to such an opinion? For this kind of
 question reveals an alienness that is clearly of a quite different
 kind and ultimately signifies a renunciation of shared meaning" (187)

 Spinoza: there are meanings in the Bible "that cannot be derived from
 the principles known to us by natural reason" (188)

 Some meanings "can be understood if only we understand the mind of the
 author "historically"---i.e., overcome our prejudices and think of
 nothing but what the author could have had in mind (188)

 "the 'naturalness' of the understanding of Scripture depends on the
 fact that what makes sense can be understood at sight, and what does
 not can be understood 'historically'" (188)

 In this way, the "scientific method" is also based on "the model of
 *philology*" (189)

 Chladenius: "point of view" "a concept of optics" "borrows from
 Liebniz" (189)

 Chladenius: "understanding and interpretation are not the same thing":
 interpretation is "pedagogical and *occasional*" (189)

 Chladenius: interpretation seeks "**perfect** understanding of a
 passage", while understanding as such seeks the "**true**
 understanding of a passage." This is to say, *interpretation* seeks to
 overcome "obscurities" in Chaldenius's view (189)

 "Chladenius reaches a highly interesting conclusion. He sees that to
 understand an author perfectly is not the same thing as to understand
 speech or writing perfectly. The norm for understanding a book is not
 the author's meaning. For, "since men cannot be aware of everything,
 their words, speech and writing can mean something that they
 themselves did not intend to say or write," and consequently "when
 trying to understand their writings, one can rightly think of things
 that had not occurred to the writers"" (190)

 Chladenius: "the real task of hermeneutics is not to understand this
 "more," but to understand the true meaning of the books themselves
 (i.e., their content)" (190)

<br>

##### 3.1.1.2 Schleiermacher's Project of a Universal Hermeneutics

 **Unintelligibility** in Spinoza "motivates the detour via the
 historical"; in Chladenius "involves the art of interpretation" and is
 "directed entirely toward the subject matter"; but in Schleiermacher
 has "a completely different, universal significance"

 Schleiermacher's **big difference:** hermeneutics is not concerned
 with "a lack of understanding [but with] misunderstanding" (191)

 For Schleiermacher, *interpretation and understanding are closely
 interwoven, like the outer and the inner word, and every problem of
 interpretation is, in fact, a problem of understanding* (191)

 With Schleiermacher "we no longer consider the difficulties and
 failures of understanding as occasional but as integral elements that
 have to be prevented in advance" (191)

 Thus hermeneutics is "**the art of avoiding misunderstanding**" (191)

 This "rises above the pedagogical occasionality of interpretation and
 acquires the independence of a method, inasmuch as "misunderstanding
 follows automatically and understanding must be desired and sought at
 every point"" (191)

 "The art of hermeneutics has **never** been the organon of the **study
 of things**" (192). This means it is different from Schleiermacher's
 **dialectics**. But still, "there is reference to the truth [I
 suppose, a thing?] that lies hidden in the text and must be brought
 to light. What is to be understood is, in fact, not a thought
 considered as part of another's life, but as a truth ... [thus]
 hermeneutics ... remains subordinate to the study of things" (192)

 Hermeneutics is not restricted to "foreign languages, or to the
 written word" but is in all language, speech and conversation and
 listening included (192)

 So in Schleiermacher, "What is to be understood is now not only the
 exact words and their objective meaning, but also the individuality of
 the speaker or author" (192)

 Spinoza's "limiting case of intelligibility" becomes a "norm" for
 Schleiermacher (192)

 Schleiermacher: understanding requires "*understanding a succession of
 thoughts as an emerging element of life, as an act that is connected
 with many others, even of another kind*" (192)

 Schleiermacher's interpretation is both *grammatical* and
 *psychological:* it is *divinatory.* It requires "a re-creation of the
 creative act. Thus understanding is a reproduction of an original
 production, a knowing of what has been known" (193)

 Schleiermacher hermeneutics is a divining of "artistic thoughts", i.e.
 genius, à la Kant (193)

 *What is to be understood here is not a shared thought about some
 subject matter, but individual thought that by its very nature is a
 free construct and the free expression of an individual being* (194)

 Speaking is an art (rhetoric), and so also, for Schleiermacher, is
 understanding (194)

 *all speech and all texts are basically related to the art of
 understanding, hermeneutics, and this explains the connection between
 rhetoric ... and hermeneutics* (194)

 **[E]very** **act of understanding is for Schleiermacher the inverse
 of an act of speech, the reconstruction of a construction. Thus
 hermeneutics is a kind of inversion of rhetoric and poetics** (194)

 Speech is, for Schleiermacher, "an expression of a creative
 productivity" [again, **genius**] (195)

 "Genius itself creates models and rules. It creates new ways of using
 language, new literary forms ... In hermeneutics, what corresponds to
 the production of genius is divination, the immediate solution, which
 ultimately presupposes a kind of **con-geniality**" (195)

 "individuality is always being expressed and hence an element of
 rule-free genius is always at work"

 **[T]he ultimate ground of all understanding must always be a
 divinatory act of congeniality, the possibility of which depends on a
 pre-existing bond between all individuals** (195)

 Schleiermacher: "all individuality is a manifestation of universal
 life and hence "everyone carries a tiny bit of everyone else within
 him, so that divination is stimulated by comparison with onself" ...
 [thus] the individuality of the author can be grasped "by, as it
 were, transforming oneself into the other"" (195)

 *For the extremes of alienness and familiarity are both given with the
 relative difference of all individuality* (195)

 **the meaning of the part can be discovered only from the context**
 (196)

 Schleiermacher "*applie[s] [this] to psychological understanding,*
 which necessarily understands every structure of thought as an element
 in the total context of a man's life" (196)

 "understanding is always a movement in this kind of circle [whole and
 part], which is why the repeated return from the whole to the parts,
 and vice versa, is essential" (196)

 "Moreover, the circle is constantly expanding, since the concept of
 the whole is relative, and being integrated in ever larger contexts
 always affects the understanding of the individual part ...
 **understanding is provisional and unending**" (196)

 "the barrier to reason and understanding that remains here [alienness
 of the Thou] is not entirely insuperable. It is to be overcome by
 *feeling,* by an immediate, sympathetic, and con-genial understanding.
 Hermeneutics is an *art* and not a mechanical process" (197)

 Schleiermacher's problem is "the obscurity of the Thou" (197)

 "meaning is revealed only in ... the oscillating movement between
 whole and part" (197)

 "The circular movement is necessary because "nothing that needs
 interpretation can be understood at once"" (197)

 Schleiermacher's *identification* [with the spirit of genius] is not
 "mere equation" (197)

 *Production* [by the author] and *reproduction* [by the
 interpreter] are distinct (198)

 "Thus Schleiermacher asserts that the aim is ***to understand a writer
 better than he understood himself***" (198)

 **[T]his statement contains the whole problem of hermeneutics**
 (198)

 For Schleiermacher this is clear "understanding [is] the
 reconstruction of the production" (198)

 "Creation by **artistic genius** is the model on which this theory of
 unconscious production and necessarily conscious reproduction is
 based" (198)

 *Better understanding* is better because "thematized understanding of
 an opinion as opposed to actualizing its contents implies an increased
 knowledge" (198)

 *the artist who creates something is not the appointed interpreter of
 it ... Insofar as he reflects on his own work, he is his own reader.
 The meaning that he, as reader, gives his own work does not set the
 standard ... it is not the author's reflective self-interpretation
 but the unconscious meaning of the author that is to be understood*
 (199)

 Schleiermacher changed the "statement that the aim is to understand an
 author better than he understood himself" from its origin, first found
 in Fichte and Kant (199)

 Originally, understanding for the humanist included *imitation* and
 *surpassing of the model* (200)

 But still, even as a rival, the interpreter was *obligated* to the
 original (200)

 "not until Schleiermacher ... could the interpreter claim superiority
 over his object" (200)

 With Fichte and Kant, this hermeneutic "rule" was "a philosophical
 claim to move beyond the contradictions of a given theory by achieving
 greater conceptual clarity" (200)

 *Someone who is better able to think his way through what an author is
 talking about will be able to see what the author says in the light of
 a truth hidden from the author* (200-201)

 So originally, the sense is "completely different" from
 Schleiermacher's (201)

 Schleiermacher "reinterpreted this principle of philosophical critique
 and made it a principle of philological interpretation" (201)

 NOTE 47:

 Schlegel: "One must also be able to know, characterize, and construct
 the principles of the confusion itself" (269). Schlegel's
 understanding is understanding the actual meaning of a work, and also
 any confusion itself

 Schelling: "if a person says and maintains things, the meaning of
 which it was impossible for him to realize fully, either because of
 the age in which he lived or because of his other pronouncements ..."
 (269). Schelling sees the limits of self-understanding and need for
 outside critique

 Chladenius: the "distinction" between "understanding an author" and
 "understanding a text" (269)

 "Schleiermacher's formula, as he understands it, no longer pertains to
 the subject matter under discussion; rather, he views the statement a
 text makes as free production, and disregards its content as
 knowledge" (201)

 "he organizes hermeneutics ... according the normative example of
 language itself" (201)

 Schleiermacher: "True historical significance rises above history.
 Phenomena exist, like miracles, only to direct our attention towards
 the Spirit that playfully generates then"

 Gadamer says this a "tremendous" step that "led from Schleiermacher's
 hermeneutics to a universal understanding of the historical sciences"
 (201)

 But, it is "**a universality with very perceptible limits**" that only
 really applies to "texts whose authority was undisputed" (201)

 Dogmatic interest is set aside, because the knowledge-content of the
 subject matter is set aside. None of it could "influence a procedure
 that was able to grasp every text as an expression of life and ignore
 the truth of what was said" (202)

 *For this reason [Schleiermacher's] hermeneutical theory was still a
 long way from a historiology that could serve as a methodological
 organon for the human sciences. Its goal was the exact understanding
 of particular texts, which was to be aided by the universality of its
 historical contexts. This is **Schleiermacher's limitation**, and the
 historical worldview had to move beyond it* (202)

<br>

#### 3.1.2 The Connection Between the Historical School and Romantic Hermeneutics

##### 3.1.2.1 The Dilemma Involved in the Ideal of Universal History

 *Universal history* is "the history of mankind as a whole" (202)

 By "investigating tradition" the historians adopted the method of
 hermeneutics (as outlined in the section on Schleiermacher" for the
 "methodology of universal history": **the schema of whole and part**
 (202)

 Dilthey took *romantic hermeneutics* and expanded it into *historical
 method,* "indeed into an epistemology of the human sciences" (203)

 "It is not just that the sources are texts, but historical reality
 itself is a text that has to be understood" (203)

 So the "pantheistic metaphysics of individuality" (from Kant's genius
 developing into Schleiermacher's hermeneutics) "was a decisive
 influence on the theory of historical research in the nineneteenth
 century" (203)

 The historical school rejected Hegel's (a priori concepts of) Spirit
 and Idea for Schleiermacher's "concept of individuality"("every text
 as an expression of life") that inclined them "toward research" and so
 "drove history into the wake of philology" (203)

 The historical school was wary of Hegel's unhistorical outside, so for
 them history could only "be understood ... from historical tradition
 itself" (204)

 *"Thus the foundation for the study of history is hermeneutics"* (204)

 Dilthey "built his work entirely upon the basis of romantic
 hermeneutics" (204)

 Hence, history is a "totality of meaning" that is *detached* from "the
 person understanding it." This is Schleiermacher's influence. History
 "is always an alien individuality that must be judged according to its
 own concepts and criteria of value, but can nevertheless be understood
 because I and Thou are of the same life" (204)

 The historical school is concerned with the *specific,* against
 Hegel's *absolute.* "But since the whole can never be given to the
 empirical researcher [who is nevertheless concerned with the "whole"
 of universal history], how can he maintain his ground against the
 philosopher and his a priori arbitrariness?" (204)

 Herder: the *exemplary* and *unrepeatable* of a historical period
 gives it "its own right to exist, its own perfection" (205). This we
 see is history *for itself*, not *for an end* outside itself. The
 historical school did everything it could to resist "a criterion that
 is beyond history" (205)

 But Gadamer goes on to argue that this perspective still "is not as
 free from metaphysical assumptions as it believes itself to be" (206)

 So:

 For the historical school, the idea (Hegel: "truth in itself and for
 itself") "is only imperfectly represented in history" (206)

 Rather than an abstract absolute, the historical school grounds itself
 in the "plenitude and variety of the human [which] is increasingly
 realized in the unending vicissitudes of human destinies: this is a
 reasonable formulation of the basic assumption of the historical
 school" (206-207)

 This is a **humanist ideal** (207)

 A "rich variety" is "distinctive of historical life" and is "what
 constitutes the value and meaning of history" (207)

 The humanistic ideal "is based on the formal idea of the greatest
 variety" (207)

 *History has a meaning in itself. What seems to speak against it---the
 transience of all that is earthly---is in fact its real basis. In
 impermanence itself lies the mystery of an inexhaustible productivity
 of historical life* (207)

 Herder: "continuity ... is the manifestation of historical reality
 itself" (208). History emerges "according to strict laws of
 succession" (208)

 Ranke: history "has no fixed goal that can be discovered outside
 itself. To this extent there is no necessity, knowable a priori, at
 work in history" (208)

 "*But the structure of historical continuity is still teleological,
 and its criterion is success ... successive events*" (208)

 **The ontological structure of history itself, then, is teleological,
 although without a telos** (208)

<br>

##### 3.1.2.2 Ranke's Historical Worldview

 Ranke: "the links that create historical continuity are "scenes of
 freedom"" (208)

 This means that "in the infinite web of events there are particularly
 significant incidents in which historical decisions are, as it were,
 concentrated" (208)

 "Decisions are made wherever actions are **performed in freedom**" and
 these decisions "make[] history" when they "decide[] *something*,"
 when they have a "full and lasting significance" (209)

 So Ranke still thinks like Hegel. Hegel calls these people "historic
 individuals" and Ranke calls them "original minds" (209)

 For Ranke, history is not determined as with Hegel, yet it has an
 "**inner coherence**" (209). Gadamer interrogates what this coherence
 really is

 Quoting Ranke: "a deepinner coherence penetrates everywhere, and no
 one is entirely independent of it. **Beside freedom stands
 necessity**. It consists in what has already been formed and cannot be
 destroyed, which is the basis of all new activity. **What has already
 come into being coheres with what is coming into being**" (209)

 Significant for Gadamer is the linkage between **the concept of
 freedom** and **the concept of power** (209)

 Power is "central" to the "historical worldview because in it
 interiority and exteriority are held in a peculiarly tense unity"
 (210)

 *All power exists only in its expression* (210)

 But *power is [also] more than its expression. It possesses
 potentiality* (210)

 Power cannot just be "known or measured in terms of its expressions,
 but only **experienced as an indwelling**" (210)

 *Interiority is the mode of experiencing power because power, of its
 nature, is related to itself alone* (210)

 **Ontologically, power is "inwardness"** (210)

 Ranke: ""Freedom is combined with power." For power that is more than
 its expression is always freedom" (210)

 This is "decisive" for the historian: "everything could have been
 different, and every acting individual could have acted differently"
 (210)

 *necessity ... [is] the resistance that free power encounters*
 (211)

 "The resistance that free power encounters is itself freedom" (211)

 This necessity, then, is "the power of what has been transmitted ...
 Necessity itself comes from freedom and is itself qualified by the
 freedom that reckons with it" (211)

 Necessity is *historical being:* "what has come into being" (211)

 *In that what has come into existence persists as a foundation for the
 new, it sets the new action within a unified context* (211)

 *that what comes into being is free, but the freedom from which it
 comes is always limited by what has come into being---i.e., by the
 situation into which it comes* (211)

 For the historians, the "essence of historical being" is that "the
 idea never attains full representation in history"---"plans" and
 "views" are disregarded in favour of the "**historical effects that
 reveal historical powers**" (211)

 "the category of power" renders "the coherence of history as a primary
 given" (211)

 **Power is real always only as an interplay of powers, and history is
 this interplay of powers that produces a continuity** (212)

 This production, Gadamer writes, is the "growing sum" of which Ranke
 and Droysen write (212)

 History = "a growing sum" = "a whole---though and unfinished one"
 (212)

 Since a whole is comprised of its parts, this "presupposes that the
 unity in terms of which they [the parts; the interplay of powers]
 are grouped is already the criterion of that grouping" because
 "[i]tems that are qualitatively different cannot be added up" (212)

 So thinkers like Ranke and Droysen are asserting the *unity* of the
 *variety* of historical powers and effects that produce the continuity
 (the whole; the unity) of history, bringing them back to Hegel without
 Hegel's Spirit

 Herodotus: history not the "unity of world history" but a "moral
 phenomenon" (212)

 Before, when history had a telos, talking about the unity of it was
 justified. So with the historians, Gadamer asks, "what is the common
 denominator that allows historical events to be grouped together if
 this kind of goal and plan in history is not accepted?" (212)

 *In the continuity of events there must be the* something *that
 emerges as a goal giving an orientation to the whole* (212)

 **The idea of the unity of world history implies the uninterrupted
 continuity of the development of world history** (212)

 Thus Gadamer highlights Ranke's "methodological naivete" (213)

 The "historical consciousness" of the historians is conditioned by the
 particularity of Western culture and its "continuous development"
 (212). Only because the West *happened* to develop as it did (in its
 freedom) "can the question of its meaning be raised by a
 world-historical consciousness and the unity of its continuity be
 meant" (213)

 Indeed, Gadamer argues, "continuity constitutes the form of cultural
 existence" in the West (213)

 This all means that "the empirical orientation of the historical
 sciences is not without philosophical assumptions" (213)

 "Unlike the mere repetitiveness of nature, history is characterized by
 this increase within itself" (after Aristotle's *epidosis eis hauto*)
 (214)

 "The amazing steadiness of historical development of which Ranke spoke
 is based on the consciousness of continuity, a consciousness that
 makes history history" (214)

 *the continuity of Western cultural tradition [is] the very
 condition of the existence of Western culture. The collapse of this
 tradition, the rise of a new barbarism, which [Jakob] Burckhardt
 prophesied, would not, for the historical worldview, be a catastrophe
 within history but the end of world history itself, at least insofar
 as it tries to understand itself as a world-historical unity* (214)

 World-history is entirely, decidedly Western. So if the West ends, so
 does world-history.

 **It is important to recognize this presupposition in the historical
 school's inquiry into universal history precisely because its
 existence is fundamentally denied** (214)

 By this Gadamer means that, although the historical school rejected
 Hegel's Beyond, situating themselves within the continual
 *ongoingness* (and so also *eternality* and *totality*) of history,
 they nevertheless assert the being of world-history in the continuity
 of the West, which, in dialectical negation to the East, necessarily
 has a beyond.

 But as Gadamer writes, the "historical school" just "could not accept"
 Hegel's spirit (214)

 So the historical school ends up with a "theological understanding of
 itself"--- "it had to relate its own finite and limited knowledge to a
 divine spirit, to which things are known in their perfection. It is
 the old ideal of infinite understanding applied to the knowledge of
 history" (214)

 So the "old idea" of "infinite understanding" is "transformed into the
 original image of historical impartiality" and the historian, in his
 impartiality, "approximates" God's divine knowledge in practice (215)

 *The re-establishment of the immediacy that existed before the fall
 does not take place through the church's means of grace alone. The
 historian has a share in it too* (215)

 "in historical thinking, the universe, as the divine creation, is
 raised to a consciousness of itself" (215)

 *the ultimate result of the study of history is "sympathy,
 co-knowledge of the universe* (215)

 Ranke desired "to extinguish himself" (i.e. enter into the totality of
 the divine creation) because "all historical phenomena are
 manifestations of universal life, [and so] to share in them is to
 share in life" (215)

 So then, *to understand is to participate immediately in life* (215)

 The historian "is concerned with ... not relating reality to ideas,
 but everywhere reaching the point where "life thinks and thought
 lives"" (215)

 Here Ranke gets very close to Fichte and Hegel (215) and so Gadamer
 demonstrates how close "Ranke remained ... to German idealism" (216)

 **The historian, as Ranke sees him, belongs to that form of absolute
 spirit Hegel called religion of art** (216)

<br>

##### 3.1.2.3 The Relation Between Historical Study and Hermeneutics in J. G. Droysen

 Droysen is more "acute" than Ranke (216)

 Droysen "tries to free the concept of understanding from the
 indefiniteness of the aesthetic-pantheistic communion that it has in
 Ranke" (216)

 The first "conceptual presupposition" of understanding is
 "expression." Expression is what understanding understands. "In
 expression something interior is immediately present" (216)

 This interior or "inner essence" is "the first and true reality" (216)

 Droysen is thus a Cartesian, in the tradition of Kant and Humboldt
 (216)

 "The individual ego" is alone in "the world of appearances," but the
 ego is no longer alone in "the world of the intelligible," "in its
 utterances ... and in all the forms in which it expresses itself"
 (216)

 Droysen is clarifying Ranke's emphasis on power, over against Hegel's
 "pure spirit" (217)

 The "world of history ... consists in the mind's constantly renewed
 effort to grasp and form the "ever-changing finite systems" to which
 every person belongs (217)

 "What he investigates is not individuals as such, but what they mean
 as elements in the movement of moral powers" (217)

 *Moral powers* are the "basis of both history's mode of being and the
 possibility of knowing it" (217)

 *Necessity* = "the course of things" = the development and movement of
 moral powers

 Necessity "is not an extrinsic barrier to freedom, for it depends not
 on rigid necessity but on the movement of the moral powers" (218)

 Droysen: "necessity" = "unconditional moral imperative" and "freedom"
 = "unconditional will"

 *both are expressions of the moral power by which the individual
 belongs to the moral sphere* (218)

 "The moral power of the individual becomes a historical power insofar
 as it is at work on the great common goals" (218)

 *the continuity of the historical process consists in this constant
 overcoming of what is*

 **freedom is the fundamental pulse of historical life**

 Against "historical apriorism": "we cannot see the end but only the
 direction of the movement" (219)

 Droysen does away with Ranke's pantheistic co-knowledge, in favour of
 "the intermediaries in which understanding moves" (219)

 *Droysen's formula for historical knowledge is "understanding through
 research" ... [which] implies both an infinite mediation and an
 ultimate immediacy* (219)

 Expression leads to *conscience*

 "The world of history depends on freedom, and this on the mystery of
 the person that is ultimately unfathomable by research" (220)

 Droysen: "With respect to men, human utterances, and forms, we are,
 and feel ourselves to be, essentially similar and in a condition of
 mutuality" (221)

 *Just as understanding connects the individual ego with the moral
 commonalities to which it belongs, so also these moral commonalities
 themselves---**family, people, state, and religion**---can be
 understood as expressions* (221)

 Hence, through **expression,** "*in Droysen's deliberations on method
 too hermeneutics becomes the master key to the study of history*"
 (221)

 "Understanding history, like understanding a text, culminates in
 "spiritual presence"" (221)

 **For Droysen too the aim of historical research is to reconstruct the
 great text of history from the fragments of tradition** (221)

### 3.2 Dilthey's Entanglement in the Aporias of Historicism

#### 3.2.1 From the Epistemological Problem of History to the Hermeneutic Foundation of the Human Sciences

 Dilthey wants to construct a "viable epistemological basis between
 historical experience and the idealistic heritage of the historical
 school" (223)

 Influenced by developments after Kant with "the claim of the pure
 science of reason ... extended to historical knowledge" (223)

 So Dilthey needs to provide a "philosophical grounding" for historical
 knowledge as Kant did for natural knowledge (223)

 Hegel was "the last and most universal representative of ancient logos
 philosophy" (225)

 Dilthey was against this, but also the dogmatism of neo-Kantianism and
 of British empiricism. Dilthey instead begins with the proposition
 that the "external world" is a "historical world" because it is
 "constituted and formed by the human mind" (225)

 Dilthey: "*The first condition of possibility of a science of history
 is that I myself am a historical being, that the person studying
 history is the person making history"* (225)

 "What makes historical knowledge possible is the homogeneity of
 subject and object" (225)

 So HOW does "individual experience and the knowledge of it come to be
 historical experience"? (225)

 For Dilthey, knowledge of the historical world requires Erlebnis,
 which creates an identity between *consciousness* and *object*---an
 "indivisible consciousness" (226)

 Thus "ideality of meaning" emerges from the "historical reality of
 life" (226)

 "the structural coherence of life is defined as relation between the
 whole and the parts. Every part expresses something of the whole of
 life" (227)

 Dilthey needs to get to *historical coherence,* which is the
 **object** of his inquiry, without metaphysical categories like
 Hegel's Idea (227)

 So:

 An individual is "a unity that is intelligible in itself, a unity of
 life that is expressed in every one of its manifestations and hence
 can be understood in each of them"---this is "structural coherence" or
 Husserl's "significance" (228)

 "Consciousness ... is always already involved in coherence and has
 its own being in intending it" (229)

 "Life itself, flowing temporality, is ordered toward the formation of
 enduring units of significance" (229)

 History is the outcome of the actions and intentions of historical
 beings historical beings are unities of life therefore history is a
 unity of unities of life (see note 233)

<br>

#### 3.2.2 The Conflict Between Science and Life-Philosophy in Dilthey's Analysis of Historical Consciousness

 To do this, Dilthey has to locate knowledge within life. Because life
 is ordered toward these unities, it is coherent, and thus knowable, so
 knowledge inheres in life. This is a romantic notion of the immanence
 of knowledge in life.

 But then, Dilthey is also enlightenment influenced, so knowledge
 (reflection, thought) leads to doubt, which is incoherence. The world
 produces doubt because of its incoherence and *un*knowability.

 So knowledge at once emerges from life as a manifestation of the
 coherence of life, and also from outside and against life and its
 *in*coherence. PARADOX (see note 239)

<br>

### 3.3 Overcoming the Epistemological Problem Through Phenomenological Research

#### 3.3.1 The Concept of Life in Husserl and Count Yorck

Husserl: what is *given*? (244)

Not an objective *I* but a *life-world,* a *unified flow of experience*

 Consciousness is temporal. So experience*s* are not important, but
 experience, the flow of experiences, is. This world of experience,
 consciousness in continuity and temporality, is given to knowledge

 The flip side of this is the Ur-Ich, the primal I, the
 phenomenologically reduced self, that experiences the life-world,
 indeed constitutes it

 So the life-world and Ur-Ich that inhabits it together are given to
 each other and to knowledge as a unity

 But something threatens Husserl's project:

 ""Life" is also, and no less, the transcendentally reduced
 subjectivity that is the source of all objectifications" (249)

 So the unity of the life-world kind of breaks down with Husserl's
 privileging of the Ur-Ich in the life-world relation/experience. As
 Dilthey, "the concept of life" just isn't handled all that well, or at
 least is not productive enough for Gadamer (251)

 Count Yorck:

 "Life is self-assertion"

 "The structure of being-alive consists in being primordial division
 ... in still continuing to assert itself as a unity in division and
 articulation"

 This division is also *judgment*

 Judgment is "the essence of self-consciousness, for even if it always
 distinguishes itself into what is itself and what is other, it still
 consists---as a living thing---in the play and interplay of the
 factors that constitute it"

 So we see in Yorck that the life to which Dilthey and Husserl appeal
 is *self-consciousness* (judgment, division), an identity found in
 Hegel (who they opposed!!)

 The task of philosophical reflection on the structure of being is "to
 understand the achievements of consciousness in terms of their origin,
 understanding them as results---i.e., as the projection of the
 original being-alive and its original division" (254)

<br>

#### 3.3.2 Heidegger's Project of a Hermeneutic Phenomenology

 Heidegger also began with "understanding in terms of life" but,
 against Husserl, he critiqued the "self-givenness of experience,"
 arguing that "[p]henomenology should be ontologically based on the
 facticity of Dasein, existence, which cannot be based on or derived
 from anything else" (255)

 **What does this mean?**

 Basically: Husserl and Dilthey tried to "define" life in a scientific
 way, and they came up with all these creative but ultimately
 paradoxical, nonsensical, or broken ways of doing so. For instance,
 Husserl made life a "life-world" of subject and object, but
 nevertheless, the life-world preserved the privilege of the subject
 over the object, and thus all of the problems of objectivism remained
 undealt with in reality. For Heidegger, though, Dasein is a fact, but
 it cannot be derived (i.e. defined) from anything else

 "Heidegger's aim ... was from the beginning more that of a teleology
 in reverse. He regarded his own work not so much as the fulfillment of
 a long prepared development but, rather, as a return to the beginnings
 of Western philosophy and a revival of the long forgotten Greek
 argument about "being"" (257)

 **Heidegger's thesis was that being itself is time** (257)

 **Understanding is ... the *original form of the realization of Dasein, which is being-in-the-world**(260)

 "understanding is Dasein's mode of being, insofar as it is
 potentiality-for-being and "possibility"" (260)

 "Understanding is the original characteristic of the being of human
 life itself" (260)

 "all knowing activity" is coordinated with "what is known" because
 "they both have the *mode of being of historicity*" (262)

 In all of this, the "problem of hermeneutics becomes universal in
 scope, even attaining a new dimension, through his transcendental
 interpretation of understanding. The interpreter's belonging to his
 object, which the historical school was unable to offer any convincing
 account of, now acquires a concretely demonstrable significance" (264)

 "the structure of Dasein is thrown projection" (264)

 **in realizing its own being Dasein is understanding** (264)

 "Dasein that projects itself on its own potentiality-for-being has
 always already "been"" (264)

<br>

## 4 Elements of a Theory of Hermeneutic Experience

### 4.1 The Elevation of the Historicity of Understanding to the Status of a Hermeneutic Principle

#### 4.1.1 The Hermeneutic Circle and the Problem of Prejudices

##### 4.1.1.1 Heidegger's Disclosure of the Fore-structure of Understanding

 Heidegger enters into the debate to "explicate the fore-structure of
 understanding" (278)

 So Gadamer, now, "freed from the ontological obstructions of the
 scientific concept of objectivity" seeks to "do justice to the
 historicity of understanding" (278)

 "Heidegger derives the circular structure of understanding [whole and
 part] from the temporality of Dasein" (278)

 Heidegger: "In the circle is hidden a positive possibility of the most
 primordial kind of knowing" (279)

 Heidegger: The task of interpretation is "never to allow our
 fore-having, fore-sight, and fore-conception to presented to us by
 fancies and popular concepts, but rather to make the scientific theme
 secure by working out these fore-structures in terms of the things
 themselves" (279)

 *A person who is trying to understand a text is always projecting*
 (279)

 "He projects a meaning for the text as a whole as soon as some initial
 meaning emerges in the text. Again, the initial meaning emerges only
 because he is reading the text with particular expectations in regard
 to a certain meaning. Working out this fore-projection, which is
 constantly revised in terms of what emerges as he penetrates into the
 meaning, is understanding what is there" (279)

 "The process that Heidegger describes is that every revision of the
 fore-projection is capable of projecting before itself a new
 projection of meaning" (280)

 *This constant process of new projection constitutes the movement*
 [the circular structure] *of understanding and interpretation* (280)

 The interpreter must avoid "distraction from fore-meanings that are
 not borne out by the things themselves. Working out appropriate
 projections, anticipatory in nature, to be confirmed "by the things"
 themselves, is the constant task of understanding. The only
 "objectivity" here is the confirmation of a fore-meaning in its being
 worked out" (280)

 So understanding involves discovering a *difference* between our
 "fore-meaning" and the meaning of the text (280)

 This discovery takes place "in the experience of being pulled up short
 by the text" (280)---the text does not yield what we expect it to

 This why our "meanings cannot be understood in an arbitrary way,"
 because understanding the "meaning of another" cannot be accomplished
 if we "stick blindly to our fore-meaning about the thing" (281)

 To understanding we must "remain open to the meaning of the other
 person or text" (281)

 This openness means "situating the other meaning in relation to the
 whole of our meanings or ourselves in relation to it" (281)

 *a person trying to understand a text is prepared for it to tell him
 something* (282)

 One must be **sensitive to the text's alterity**

 This sensitivity is "the foregrounding and appropriation of one's own
 fore-meanings and prejudices ... [of] one's own bias ... so that
 the text can present itself in all its otherness and thus assert its
 own truth against one's own fore-meanings" (282)

 This questioning mode of understanding allows us to make "our
 scientific theme "secure"" (like Heidegger) *from the things
 themselves* (282)

 So we must "exclude[] everything that could hinder us from
 understanding [a text] in terms of the subject matter" (282)

 "It is the tyranny of hidden prejudices that makes us deaf to what
 speaks to us in tradition" (282)

 In his discussion, Heidegger encounters ideas that his challenge his
 own, but in situating his discussion in tradition he is able to
 ""secure[]" the scientific theme" by "putting it, in a sense, at
 risk" (283). He allows the historical (i.e. the traditional, the
 prejudiced, the subjective) to enter his "objective" discussion (283)

 In his discussion of fore-structure Heidegger reveals "the fundamental
 prejudice of the Enlightenment [to be] the prejudice against
 prejudice itself, which denies tradition its power" (283)

 So, let's stop here and rearticulate this.

 Heidegger says: all understanding is "fore-understanding"---that is,
 all understanding is *prejudiced.* We bring to all interpretive events
 our "fore-meanings" and "fore-sights" and "fore-havings" and
 "fore-conceptions." Put simply, we are always *biased.*

 But this is not a fatal relativism. Our meanings can never be
 *arbitrary.* One cannot hold a perfectly arbitrary meaning of an
 object (a thing itself) because our meanings always intersect with
 other meanings, even if that "other" is the "subject matter" of a text
 alone (which, obviously, was produced at some point by another biased
 subject). These intersections demand that we revise our
 "fore-projection" and project a "new projection of meaning"

 So, if we are open to an object, even if our "fore-projection" is
 arbitrary or wrong, when we encounter the object in its "truth" (i.e.
 its self-projection, its totality), our fore-projection, as a *part*
 of the object's *whole* of meaning, will either be confirmed in its
 unity with the object, or will be shown to be in error and required to
 be revised. This is circularity of understanding, the movement of
 whole and part. Certainly, one can resist this movement and refuse to
 revise one's meaning, but then one refuses understanding.

 So, we must allow prejudices into our discussion, which means we must
 allow tradition into our discussion. There is no "pure reason" because
 prejudice always intervenes into the purely rational.

 Prejudice: "a judgment that is rendered before all the elements that
 determine a situation have been finally examined" (283)

 Prejudice "certainly does not necessarily mean a false judgment" (283)

 But the Enlightenment felt that such pre-judgments had "no foundation
 in the things themselves" (283), but such a conclusion "follows only
 in the spirit of rationalism" (284) and "following the rule of
 Cartesian doubt"

<br>

##### 4.1.1.2 The Discrediting of Prejudice by the Enlightenment

 The Enlightenment saw two basic types of prejudice: "due to human
 authority" and "due to overhastiness" (284)

 "the Enlightenment tends to accept no authority and to decide
 everything before the judgment seat of reason" (285)

 *It is not tradition but reason that constitutes the ultimate source
 of all authority* (285)

 **We can know better** (285): the "maxim with which the modern
 Enlightenment approaches tradition" (285)

 Romanticism is just a counterrevolution. The Enlightenment discredits
 mythos and hails logos; Romanticism just reverses this. "All criticism
 of the Enlightenment now proceeds via this romantic mirror image of
 the Enlightenment: (286)

 The Enlightenment and Romanticism are dogmatic halves of the same
 whole (287)

 So Gadamer wants to remove the prejudice against prejudice, and so
 open "the way to an appropriate understanding of the finitude which
 dominates not only our humanity but also our historical consciousness"
 (288)

 *Finitude* is important here because both Enlightenment *logos* and
 Romantic *mythos* posited an access to the total, to the infinite. But
 as Heidegger showed, and Gadamer shows in hermeneutics as well, we are
 fundamentally finite, and such "infinite" access, either through
 enlightened logos or primal mythos, is just, well, silly.

 "Does being situated within traditions really mean being subject to
 prejudices and limited in one's freedom? Is not, rather, all human
 existence, even the freest, limited and qualified in various ways?"
 (288)

 *Reason exists for us only in concrete, historical terms---i.e., it is
 not its own master but remains constantly dependent on the given
 circumstances in which it operates* (288)

 **History does not belong to us; we belong to it** (289)

 "Long before we understand ourselves through the process of
 self-examination, we understand ourselves in a self-evident way in the
 family, society, and state in which we live" (289)

 "The self-awareness of the individual is only a flickering in the
 closed circuit of historical life" (289)

 *"That is why the **prejudices** of the individual, far more than his
 judgments, **constitute the historical reality of his being***" (289)

<br>

#### 4.1.2 Prejudices as Conditions of Understanding

##### 4.1.2.1 The Rehabilitation of Authority and Tradition

 "What appears to be a limiting prejudice from the viewpoint of the
 absolute self-construction of reason in fact belongs to historical
 reality itself" (289)

 "there are **legitimate prejudices**" (289)

 So Gadamer asks: "what is the ground of the legitimacy of prejudices?"
 (289)

 The Enlightenment distinguishes between "faith in authority" and
 "using one's own reason" but it radicalized the distinction. This
 "does not preclude [authority] being a source of truth" (291)

 Authority is *not* diametrically opposed to "reason and freedom" (291)

 "the authority of persons is ultimately based not on the subjection
 and abdication of reason but on an act of acknowledgment and
 knowledge---the knowledge, namely, that the other is superior to
 oneself in judgment and insight and that for this reason his judgment
 takes precedence" (291)

 Again, authority "rests on acknowledgment and hence on an act of
 reason itself which, aware of its own limitations, trusts to the
 better insight of others" (291)

 "acknowledging authority is always connected with the idea that what
 the authority says is not irrational and arbitrary but can, in
 principle, be discovered to be true" (292)

 The Romantics recognized that "what has been handed down to us" always
 has a "legitimate" influence upon our "attitudes and behaviour" (292)

 But Romanticism "still viewed [tradition] as the abstract opposite
 of free self-determination, since its validity does not require any
 reasons but conditions us without our questioning it" (293)

 *there is no such unconditional antithesis between tradition and
 reason* (293)

 Tradition is *active:* it persists in being "affirmed, embraced,
 cultivated" (293)

 *we are always situated within traditions, and this is no objectifying
 process---i.e., we do not conceive of what tradition says as something
 other, something alien. **It is always a part of us,** a model or
 exemplar, a kind of cognizance that our later historical judgment
 would hardly regard as a kind of knowledge but as the most **ingenuous
 affinity** with tradition* (294)

 We must do away with the "*abstract antithesis between tradition and
 historical research, between history and the knowledge of it*" (294)

 "living tradition" and "historical study ... constitute a **unity of
 effect**" (294)---they always go together

 The "subject matter" (i.e. the tradition in question) "appears truly
 significant" (i.e. historical) "only when it is properly portrayed"
 (i.e. studied, interpreted, presented) (296)

 "historical consciousness is always filled with a variety of voices in
 which the echo of the past is heard. Only in the multifariousness of
 such voices does it exist: this constitutes the nature of the
 tradition in which we want to share and have a part" (296)

 History "cannot be understood teleologically in terms of the object
 into which it is inquiring" because the object is itself, and the
 inquiry is the object---i.e., as above, there is a **unity of effect**
 between the tradition and its study (i.e., it **re-presentation**)

<br>

##### 4.1.2.2 The Example of the Classical

 "The classical is something that resists historical criticism because
 its historical dominion, **the binding power of the validity that is
 preserved and handed down**, precedes all historical reflection and
 continues in it" (299)

 "The classical is ... a historical reality to which historical
 consciousness belongs and is subordinate" (299)

 "The "classical" is something raised above the vicissitudes of
 changing times and changing tastes" (299)

 Thus the "classical" has a *normative sense* (299)

 "What gives birth to the classical norm is an awareness of decline and
 distance" (300)

 *the classical is capable of being extended to any "development" to
 which an immanent telos gives unity* (300)

 "Thus the classical epitomizes a **general characteristic of
 historical being:** preservation amid the ruins of time" (301)

 "understanding [history] will always involve *more* than merely
 historically reconstructing the past "world" to which the work
 belongs. Our understanding will always retain the consciousness that
 we too belong to the world, and correlatively, that the work too
 belongs to our world" (301)

 So Gadamer asks, does "the kind of historical mediation between the
 past and the present that characterizes the classical ultimately
 underlie all historical activity as its effective substratum?" (302)

 He answers his own question:

 *"Understanding is to be thought of less as a subjective act than as
 participating in an event of tradition"* (302)

 Understanding is a "process of transmission in which past and present
 are constantly mediated" (302)

<br>

##### 4.1.2.3 The Hermeneutic Significance of Temporal Distance

 Recall the "hermeneutical rule that we must understand **the whole in
 terms of the detail** and **the detail in terms of the whole**" (302)

 "The anticipation of meaning in which the whole is envisaged becomes
 actual understanding when the parts that are determined by the whole
 themselves also determine this whole" (302)

 *the movement of understanding is constantly from the whole to the
 part and back to the whole* (302)

 "The harmony of all the details with the whole is the criterion of
 correct understanding" (302)

 "Heidegger describes the circle in such a way that the understanding
 of the text remains permanently determined by the **anticipatory
 movement of fore-understanding**. The circle of whole and part is not
 dissolved [as in Schleiermacher's divinatory act] but, on the
 contrary, is most fully realized" (304)

 The circle "is **not** formal" (305)

 *The anticipation of meaning that governs our understanding of a text
 is not an act of subjectivity, but proceeds from the commonality that
 binds us to the tradition* (305)

 "Tradition is not simply a permanent precondition [i.e. a form];
 rather, we produce it ourselves inasmuch as we understand, participate
 in the evolution of tradition, and hence further determine it
 ourselves. Thus the circle of understanding is not a "methodological"
 circle [i.e. again, a form], but describes an **element of the
 ontological structure of understanding**" (305)

 So hermeneutics is *circular,* but it also has a *fore-conception of
 completeness* (305)

 "The fore-conception of completeness that guides all our understanding
 is, then, always determined by the specific content" (305)

 "Not only does the reader assume an immanent unity of meaning, but his
 understanding is likewise guided by the constant transcendent
 expectations of meaning that proceed from the relation to the truth of
 what is being said" (305)

 "The **prejudice of completeness**, then, implies not only this formal
 element---that a text should completely express its meaning---but also
 that what it says should be the complete truth" (305-306)

 Understanding "means, primarily, to understand the content of what is
 said, and only secondarily to isolate and understanding another's
 meaning as such [as *another's*]" (306)

 So, *belonging* to a tradition "is fulfilled in the commonality of
 fundamental, enabling prejudices" (306)

 "Hermeneutics must start from the position that a person seeking to
 understand something has a bond to the subject matter that comes into
 language through the traditionary text and has, or acquires, a
 connection with the tradition from which the text speaks" (306)

 **Hermeneutics work is based on a polarity of familiarity and
 strangeness** (306)

 "It is in the play between the traditionary text's strangeness and
 familiarity to us, between a historically intended, distanced object
 and belonging to a tradition" (306)

 *"The true locus of hermeneutics is this in-between"* (306)

 There is "an insuperable difference between the interpreter and the
 author that is created by historical difference," but the "real
 meaning of a text, as it speaks to the interpreter, does not depend on
 the contingencies of the author and his original audience. It
 certainly is not identical with them, for it is always
 **co-determined** also by the historical situation of the interpreter
 and hence by the **totality** of the objective course of history"
 (307)

 *Time is no longer primarily a gulf to be bridged because it
 separates; it is actually the supportive ground of the course of
 events in which the present is rooted. Hence temporal distance is not
 something that must be overcome* (308)

 **Temporal distance** is a "positive and productive condition enabling
 understanding. It is not a yawning abyss but is filled with the
 continuity of custom and tradition" (308)

 **Temporal distance** "means something other than the extinction of
 our interest in the object. It lets the true meaning of the object
 emerge fully" (309)

 **Temporal distance** "is not fixed, but it itself undergoing constant
 movement and extension" (309)

 To *understand* requires one to *foreground* one's prejudices. To
 *foreground* one's prejudices, one must *notice* them, which means
 one's prejudices must be *provoked.* This *provocation* occurs in the
 *assertion* of another understanding's "separate validity." Thus,
 condensing Gadamer's logic, understanding "begins ... when something
 addresses us" (310)

 In this we *suspend* our prejudices, an act which "has the logical
 structure of a *question*" (310)

 "The essence of the *question* is to open up possibilities and keep
 them open" (310)

 In this openness "our own prejudice is properly brought into play by
 being put at risk. Only by being given **full play** is it able to
 experience the other's claim to truth and make it possible for him to
 have fully play himself" (310)

 **Real historical thinking must take account of its own historicity
 ... and learn to view the object as the counterpart of itself and
 hence understand both** (310)

 *The true historical object is not an object at all, but the unity of
 the one and the other, a relationship that constitutes both the
 reality of history and the reality of historical understanding* (310)

 Gadamer notes, in note 46 here, that we must be wary of
 "appropriating" the "other person in one's own understanding and
 thereby fail[] to recognize his or her otherness" (391)

 Gadamer's hermeneutics thus must "demonstrate the reality and efficacy
 of history within understanding itself"---this is "**history of
 effect**" (310)

 *"Understanding is, essentially, a historically effected event"* (310)

<br>

##### 4.1.2.4 The Principle of History of Effect (Wirkungsgeschichte)

 "If we are trying to understand a historical phenomenon from the
 historical distance that is characteristic of our hermeneutical
 situation, we are always already affected by history" (311)

 "In our understanding ... the other presents itself so much in terms
 of our own selves that there is no longer a question of self and
 other" (311)

 *in all understanding, whether we are expressly aware of it or not,
 the efficacy of history is at work* (312)

 "historically effected consciousness ... is an element in the act of
 understanding itself and, as we shall see, is already effectual in
 *finding the right questions to ask*" (312)

 HEC (historically effected consciousness) is "primarily consciousness
 of the hermeneutical *situation*" (312)

 "The very **idea of situation** means that we are not standing outside
 it and hence are unable to have any objective knowledge of it. We
 always find ourselves **within a situation**" (312)

 *"To be historically means that knowledge of oneself can never be
 complete"* (313)

 "All self-knowledge arises from what is **historically pregiven**,
 what with Hegel we call "**substance**," because it underlies all
 subjective intentions and actions, and hence both prescribes and
 limits every possibility for understanding any tradition whatsoever in
 its historical alterity" (313)

 **Every finite present has its limitations** (313)

 **Situation:** "a standpoint that limits the possibility of vision"

 Thus, a **situation** is, in effect, a ***horizon*** (313)

 The **concept of horizon** is used "to characterize the way in which
 thought is tied to its finite determinacy" (313)

 When we try to think objectively we give up our own horizon and
 "force[]" our object to "abandon its claim to be saying something
 true. We think we understand when we see the past from a historical
 standpoint" (314)

 "however, we have given up the claim to find in the past any truth
 that is valid and intelligible for ourselves. Acknowledging the
 otherness of the other in this way, making him the object of objective
 knowledge, involves the fundamental suspension of his claim to truth"
 (314)

 There are no "alien horizons" or "closed horizons" of meaning (314)

 Rather, just "as the individual is never simply an individual because
 he is always in understanding with others, so too the closed horizon
 that is supposed to enclose a culture is an abstraction. The
 historical movement of human life consists in the fact that it is
 **never absolutely bound to any one standpoint**, and hence can never
 have a truly closed horizon" (315)

 *The horizon is, rather, something into which we move and that moves
 with us. Horizons change for a person who is moving. Thus the horizon
 of the past, out of which all human life lives and which exists in the
 form of tradition, is always in motion. The surrounding horizon is not
 set in motion by historical consciousness. But in it this motion
 becomes aware of itself* (315)

 **Everything contained in historical consciousness is in fact embraced
 by a single historical horizon** (315)

 We always understand from our *own* horizon. "If we disregard
 ourselves ... we have no historical horizon" (316)

 Thus, *foregrounding* is "always reciprocal ... all foregrounding
 also makes visible that from which something is foregrounded" (316)

 The "hermeneutical situation" [or situation of understanding] is
 "determined by the prejudices that we bring with us. [Our
 prejudices] constitute, then, the **horizon** of a particular
 present, for they represent that beyond which it is impossible to see"
 (316)

 But "[i]n fact the horizon of the present is continually in the
 process of being formed because we are continually having to test all
 our prejudices" (317)

 **the horizon of the present cannot be formed without the past** (317)

 "There is no more an isolated horizon of the present in itself than
 there are historical horizons which have to be acquired. *Rather,
 understanding is always the fusion of these horizons supposedly
 existing by themselves*" (317)

 "The hermeneutic task consists in **not** covering up this tension
 [between object and present] by attempting a naïve assimilation of
 the two but in constantly bringing it [the tension] out" (317)

 *Historical consciousness is aware of its own otherness and hence
 foregrounds the horizon of the past from its own* (317)

 But, "[p]rojecting a historical horizon, then, is only one phase in
 the process of understanding; it does not become solidified into the
 self-alienation of a past consciousness, but is overtaken by our own
 present horizon of understanding" (317)

 *In the process of understanding, a **real** fusing of horizons
 occurs---which means that as the historical horizon is projected, it
 is simultaneously superseded* (317)

 "To bring about this fusion [of historical and present] in a
 regulated way is the task of what we called **historically effected
 consciousness**" (317)

 This is the "central problem of hermeneutics" and it is "**the problem
 of application**" (318)

<br>

### 4.2 The Recovery of the Fundamental Hermeneutic Problem

#### 4.2.1 The Hermeneutic Problem of Application

 Early hermeneutics is *tripartite:* 1) **subtilitas intelligendi**
 (understanding), 2) **subtilitas explicandi** (interpretation), and 3)
 **subtilitas applicandi** (application) (318)

 "The process of understanding" consists of "these three elements"
 (318)

 The use of *subtilitas* implies that these are "talents requiring
 particular finesse of mind" and not just methods (318)

 Gadamer's discussion follows from the Romantic recognition of the
 "inner unity of intelligere and explicare" but extends this unity to
 include application (318)

 "Interpretation is not an occasional, post facto supplement to
 understanding; rather, understanding is always interpretation" (318)

 But this unity "led to the third element in the hermeneutical problem,
 *application,* becoming wholly excluded from any connection with
 hermeneutics" (318), and as Gadamer showed in the immediately
 preceding section, "understanding always involves something like
 applying the text to be understood to the interpreter's present
 situation" (318-319)

 So Gadamer ultimately does not "return to the pietist tradition of the
 three **separate** "subtleties"" **but** **instead** "consider[s]
 application to be just as **integral** a part of the hermeneutical
 process as are understanding and interpretation" (319)

 If a text "is to be understood properly---i.e., according to the claim
 [def: a proclamatory event which grounds a demand] it makes---[it]
 must be understood **at every moment**, in **every concrete
 situation**, in **a new and different way**" (320)

 **Understanding here is always application** (320)

 *"Understanding proves to be an event"* (320)

 *All modes* of interpretation, including performative interpretation
 (in which the performance's "real existence" is "in being played"),
 has both cognitive and normative modes of interpretation, in which,
 respectively, the interpretation considers 1) the "subject matter"
 (cognitive) and 2) its *application* to and through the "values of
 one's own day" (normative) (321)

 Indeed, the "suggested distinction between cognitive, normative, and
 reproductive interpretation **has no fundamental validity**" (321)

 Cognitive, normative, and reproductive interpretation "**constitute
 one unitary phenomenon**" (321)

 Thus, the application allows us to "open ourselves to the superior
 claim the text makes and to respond to what it has to tell us" (322)

 Historical hermeneutics requires *application* "because it too serves
 applicable meaning, in that it explicitly and consciously bridges the
 temporal distance that separates the interpreter from the text and
 overcomes the alienation of meaning that the text has undergone" (322)

 So if we recall that *understanding* always occurs across temporal
 distance, and that in our understanding of a given object our
 consciousness is always *historically effected,* which means that it
 is influenced by pre-given *prejudices* that have been *handed down*
 by tradition, then we can say that the hermeneutic mode of
 *application* is absolutely necessary and integral to the process of
 understanding (as it exists in understanding, interpretation, and
 application), because without application the interpreter cannot
 overcome the alienation of historical alterity, because the
 interpreter refuses the *validity of the claim* of the object.

<br>

#### 4.2.2 The Hermeneutic Relevance of Aristotle

 Since we are now concerned with application, we find that "the
 problem, logically speaking, concerns the relationship between the
 universal and the particular" (322)

 Aristotle is concerned with the "right estimation of the role that
 reason has to play in moral action" (322), with "reason and with
 knowledge, not detached from a being that is becoming, but determined
 by it and determinative of it" (322)

 In Plato virtue (*arete*) = knowledge (*logos*)

 But in Aristotle, the basis of moral knowledge is not *logos* but
 *orexis,* striving, "and its development into a fixed demeanor
 (hexis)"

 Thus Aristotle's "moral knowledge" is "ethics" derived from "practice"
 and "ethos" (323)

 "the person acting must view the concrete situation in light of what
 is asked of him in general" which means that "knowledge that cannot be
 applied to the concrete situation remains meaningless and even risks
 obscuring what the situation calls for" (323)

 Thus "it is impossible for ethics to achieve the extreme exactitude of
 mathematics" (323)

 *the person acting must himself know and decide, and he cannot let
 anything take this responsibility from him* (324)

 The moral actor "must himself already have developed a demeanor that
 he is constantly concerned to preserve in the concrete situations of
 his life and prove through right behaviour" (324)

 *"For the hermeneutical problem too is clearly distinct from the
 "pure" knowledge detached from any particular kind of being"* (324)

 "moral knowledge, as Aristotle describes it, is clearly **not**
 objective knowledge"

 The moral actor "**is directly confronted with what he sees. It is
 something he has to do**" (324)

 Aristotle distinguishes between **moral knowledge (phronesis)** and
 **theoretical knowledge (episteme)** (324)

 "The human sciences stand closer to moral knowledge than to that kind
 of "theoretical" knowledge" (325)

 **The human sciences are "moral sciences"** (325)

 "Their object is man and **what he knows of himself.** But he knows
 himself as an **acting being,** and this kind of knowledge of himself
 does not seek to establish what is. An active being, rather, is
 concerned with what is not always the same but **can also be
 different**. In it he can discover the **point at which he has to
 act**. The purpose of his knowledge is to **govern his *action***"
 (325)

 *Techne* = "action governed by knowledge in an exemplary form" (325)

 Gadamer asks: is moral knowledge a *techne*?

 If it is, the *techne* of moral knowledge is "knowledge of how to make
 oneself" (325)

 Moral knowledge and the knowledge of the craftsman ("technical"
 knowledge) have the same purpose: "to **determine and guide action**"
 (325)

 Hermeneutical consciousness is **not** *technical* or *moral*
 knowledge, but it includes *"the same task of application*" (326)

 After Aristotle: "Techne loves tyche (luck) and tyche loves techne"

 Gadamer quotes this to illustrate how *situations* (i.e. points of
 action) require *techne* (which is theory or knowledge in practice)
 (326)

 "[M]oral consciousness itself calls for prior direction to guide
 action" as does *technical* consciousness in craftsmanship (326)

 And yet, moral consciousness and *techne* in the proper sense are not
 the same (326)

 "man is not at his own disposal in the same way that the craftsman's
 material is at his disposal. Clearly he cannot make himself in the
 same way that he can make something else" (326)

 Thus, for Aristotle there is a *different* knowledge from the
 *theoretical* (i.e. math) and the *technical* (i.e. craft):
 *self-knowledge* (326)

 So: how is this *self-knowledge* different from a *technical
 knowledge*?

1.  "We learn a techne and can also forget it. But we do not learn moral
    knowledge, nor can we forget it" (327)

2.  "We do not stand over against [moral knowledge] as if it were
    something that we can acquire or not, as we can choose to acquire an
    objective skill, a techne" (327)

3.  "Rather, we are always already in the situation of having to act"
    (327)

4.  To act, "we must already possess and be able to apply moral
    knowledge" (327)

5.  But "we can only apply something that we already have" (327)

6.  But again, "we do not possess moral knowledge in such a way that we
    already have it and then apply it to specific situations" (327)

7.  There is no "guiding image" that can be applied uniformly every time

8.  "What is right ... cannot be fully determined independently of the
    situation that requires a right action" (328)

9.  "every law is in a necessary tension with concrete action, in that
    is general and hence cannot contain practical reality in its full
    concreteness" (328)

10. And so: the "law is always deficient, not because it is imperfect in
    itself but because human reality is necessarily imperfect in
    comparison to the ordered world of law, and hence allows of no
    simple application of the law" (328)

11. Thus *equity* stands to "correct" the law when it is imposed to
    rigidly

 The determination of the law, it's actings or actions, is "always
 itself determined in each case by the use the moral consciousness
 makes of them" (330)

 That is to say, moral consciousness is always limited by its
 *horizon,* the boundary that moves and grows with it. Whereas *techne*
 (technical knowledge) is "particular and serves particular ends,"
 *phronesis* (moral knowledge) "pertains to right living in general"
 (330). Phronesis simultaneously is produced by and produces its
 horizon.

 "Moral knowledge can never be knowable in advance like knowledge that
 can be taught" (331)

 "There can be no anterior certainty what the good life is directed
 toward as a whole" (331)

 The "end toward which our life as whole tends and its elaboration in
 the moral principles of action ... cannot be the object of a
 knowledge that can be taught" (331)

 "Aristotle's theory of virtue describes **typical forms of the true
 mean** to be observed in human life and behaviour; but the moral
 knowledge that is oriented by these guiding images is the same
 knowledge that has to respond to the demands of the situation of the
 moment" (331)

 *[S]elf-knowledge ... includes perfect application and employs its
 knowledge in the immediacy of the given situation ... For although it
 is necessary to see what a situation is asking of us, this seeing does
 not mean that we perceive in the situation what is visible as such,
 but that we learn to see it as the situation of action and hence in
 the light of what is right ... [so] in moral deliberation, seeing
 what is immediately to be done is not a mere seeing but nous
 [intelligence, knowledge] ... Moral knowledge is really knowledge
 of a special kind ... it embraces both means and end, and ... it is
 pointless to distinguish here between knowledge and experience ...
 For moral knwoeldge contains a kind of experience in itself, and in
 fact we shall see that this perhaps the fundamental form of experience
 (Erfahrung)* (331-332)

 Aristotle's varieties of moral reflection---phronesis (thoughtful
 reflection), synesis (sympathetic understanding), gnome (insight), and
 syngnome (fellow feeling)---all indicate the *being-togetherness* of
 understanding, i.e., the determined and determining *presence in the
 situation* of the interpreter who seeks to understand. This is why
 Gadamer says that Aristotle's ethics provides a *"model of the problem
 of hermeneutics*" (333), because, as Hegel quoted earlier, the
 "empirical, comprehended in its synthesis, is the speculative concept"
 (327). The text in question is not a universal "per se" (in itself)
 (333), but is a totality of experience synthesized by and participated
 in by the historical consciousness. The interpreter "must relate the
 text to his situation [apply it] if he wants to understand at all"
 (333). This is what the moral actor must do, as Aristotle
 demonstrates, he must *be* understanding (of a situation) so as to
 make *moral* judgment, and so to must the interpreter in his
 *historical* judgment.

<br>

#### 4.2.3 The Exemplary Significance of Legal Hermeneutics

 Legal hermeneutics is considered to be a "practical measure filling a
 kind of gap in the system of legal dogmatics" (334)

 *It is only in all its applications that the law becomes concrete*
 (335)

 In law,one must "mediate between the original application and the
 present application" (335)

 "The hermeneutical situation of both the historian and the jurist
 seems to me to be the same in that, when faced with any text, **we
 have an immediate expectation of meaning**" (336)

 "There can be no such thing as a direct access to the historical
 object that would objectively reveal its historical value" (336)

 "Historical knowledge can be gained only by seeing the past in its
 continuity with the present---which is exactly what the jurist does in
 his practical, normative work" (336)

 *to understand and interpret means to discover and recognize a valid
 meaning* (337)

 "Trying to understand the law in terms of its historical origin, the
 historian cannot disregard its continuing effect: it presents him with
 the questions that he has to ask of historical tradition ... [every
 text] must be understood in terms of what it says ... [every text]
 always needs to be restated ... [and] this restatement always takes
 place through its being related to the present" (337)

 **the tradition reaching us speaks into the present and must be
 understood in this mediation---indeed, *as* this mediation** (338)

 "The way the interpreter belongs to his text is like the way the point
 from which we view a picture belongs to its perspective" (338)

 "The interpreter ... finds his point of view already given, and does
 not choose it arbitrarily" (338)

 "The need to understand and interpret arises only when something is
 enacted in such a way that it is, as enacted, irrevocable and binding"
 (338)---which is why hermeneutics is essential to history, because
 history, as the past, is inherently *binding*

 "The work of interpretation is *to concretize* the law in each
 specific case---i.e., it is a work of *application*" (338)

 Similarly, in theological hermeneutics, the "proclamation is genuinely
 concretized in preaching, as is the legal order in judgment" (339)

 "Certainly preaching too is concerned with interpreting a valid truth,
 but this truth is proclamation; and whether it is successful or not is
 not decided by the ideas of the preacher, but by the power of the word
 itself ... The proclamation cannot be detached from its fulfillment
 ... Scripture is the word of God, and that means it has an absolute
 priority over the doctrine of those who interpret it" (339)

 What is "truly common to all forms of hermeneutics" then, is that "the
 meaning to be understood is **concretized** and **fully realized**
 only in interpretation, but the interpretive activity considers itself
 **wholly bound** by the meaning of the text" (341)

 "The task of concretizing something universal and applying it to
 oneself seems, however, to have a very different function in the
 historical sciences" (341)

 In law and theology we see the same thing: "as in one case the judge
 seeks to dispense justice and in the other the preacher to proclaim
 salvation, and as, in both, the meaning of what is proclaimed finds
 its fullest realization in the proclamation of the gospel, so in the
 case of a philosophical text or a work of literature we can see that
 these texts require a special activity of the reader and interpreter,
 and that we do not have the freedom to adopt a historical distance
 toward them" (341)

 **It will be seen that here understanding always involves applying the
 meaning understood** (341)

 Modern scholarship requires *objectivity* and *distance,* but Gadamer
 shows these are impossible

 **all reading involves application, so that a person reading a text is
 himself part of the meaning he apprehends. He belongs to the text that
 he is reading. The line of meaning that the text manifests to him as
 he reads it always and necessarily breaks off in an open
 indeterminacy** (349)

 "future generations will understand differently what he has read in
 the text" (349)

 In *application,* "the critic and the historian thus emerge from the
 self-forgetfulness to which they had been banished by a thinking for
 which the only criterion was the methodology of modern science. Both
 find their true ground in *historically effected consciousness*" (349)

 *"The old unity of the hermeneutical disciplines comes into its own
 again if we recognize that historically effected consciousness is at
 work in all hermeneutical activity, that of the philologist as well as
 of the historian"* (350)

 **Application does not mean first understanding a given universal in
 itself and then afterward applying it to a concrete case. It is the
 very understanding of the universal---the text---itself. Understanding
 proves to be a kind of effect and knows itself as such** (350)

<br>

### 4.3 Analysis of Historically Effected Consciousness

#### 4.3.1 The Limitations of Reflective Philosophy

Knowledge and effect "belong together"---how? (350)

 Historically effected consciousness is "a consciousness of the work
 itself, and hence itself has an effect" (350)

 Historically effected consciousness operates through **horizons**
 (350)

 HEC *belongs* to the effect, but it can also "rise above that of which
 it is conscious"---it is *reflexive* (350)

 So: *Hegel*

 With Hegel the "claim of hermeneutics seems capable of being met only
 in the **infinity of knowledge**, in the thoughtful fusion of the
 whole of tradition with the present" (350)

 This is the "abolition of our finiteness in the infinity of knowledge"
 (351)

 "being and knowledge interpenetrate each other in the absolute" (351)

 Gadamer seeks to break free from this spell of Hegel's, the spell of
 the infinite and absolute

 **we are concerned to conceive a reality that limits and exceeds the
 omnipotence of reflection** (351)

 The prototype of a critique of Hegel is that "the other must be
 experienced not as the other of myself grasped by pure
 self-consciousness, but as a Thou ... does not seriously challenge
 him" (352)

 *every possible position is drawn into the reflective movement of
 consciousness coming to itself ... The appeal to immediacy* [the
 most convincing objection, in that the Thou is immediately present]
 ... *has always been self-refuting, in that it is not itself an
 immediate relation, but a reflective activity* (353)

 Plato refutes this position, held by the Sophists, with myth (354)

 But "Plato's mythical refutation of dialectical sophism does not
 satisfy the modern mind ... By working through the dialectic of
 reflection as the total self-mediation of reason, Hegel is
 fundamentally beyond the argumentative formalism that we, like Plato,
 call "sophistical"" (354)

 In Hegel we see the kernel of Gadamer's thought, but Gadamer pushes
 beyond, "with an eye to Hegel, setting it [his theory] against his
 own approach" (354-355)

<br>

#### 4.3.2 The Concept of Experience (Erfahrung) and the Essence of the Hermeneutic Experience

 Gadamer shares with Hegel that the "historical activity of the mind"
 (for Gadamer, HEC), is "an *experience* that experiences reality and
 is itself real," that "it has the structure of *experience*
 (Erfahrung)"

 Scientific experience is "valid only if it is confirmed; hence its
 dignity depends on its being in principle repeatable" (356). This
 position Gadamer sees in Dilthey, and for Gadamer it must be done away
 with because it limits experience to the positivity of confirmation,
 excluding the role of *negation*

 Husserl tries to do the same, "to overcome its [experience's]
 idealization by science" but Gadamer argues that Husserl is himself
 trapped, because his "pure transcendental subjectivity" is "not really
 given as such but always given in the idealization of language" (356)

 Language must be considered, which Gadamer will get to later

 Continuing on, Gadamer argues that the "positive" should not have such
 priority in our understanding of experience (358)

 Citing Aeschylus, Gadamer argues that experience is defined, more
 often than not, by the negative

 Looking at the problem through Aristotle, Gadamer sees that "the
 unity" or "universality of experience" is not the same as the
 "universality of the concept" (359). Experience consists of both
 *positive* and *negative* content

 *Experience is not science itself, but it is a necessary condition of
 it* (359)

 Experience "is not known in a previous universality. Here lies the
 **fundamental openness** of experience to new experience, not only in
 the general sense that errors are corrected, but that experience is
 essentially dependent on constant confirmation and necessarily becomes
 a different kind of experience where there is no confirmation" (360).
 This is to say, experience is fundamentally open, as it must recognize
 *negation* as much as *confirmation*. It must be willing to be changed

 Yet for Aristotle, the "universality of the concept is ontologically
 prior" to experience (361)

 But this disregards "the fact that experience is a process. In fact,
 **this process is essentially negative**" (361)

 In its negativity, experience "has a curiously productive meaning"
 (362)---it "gain[s] a better knowledge" through both confirmation
 and negation, and for this reason experience is "*dialectical*" (362)

 Hegel, like Gadamer, "testifies to the dialectical element in
 experience" (362)

 Gadamer elaborates on this dialectic:

-   When one has had an experience, one *has* it

-   Because of this possession, if one experiences the same thing a
    second time, the experience itself is not the same, because one's
    horizon of understanding has come to include the *first* experience
    of the thing

-   So the experience is *repeated* and *confirmed,* but it is also
    *different*

-   "The experiencer has become aware of his experience; he is
    "experienced." He has acquired a new horizon within which something
    can become an experience for him" (362)

 For Hegel, this dialectic "must end in that overcoming of all
 experience which is attained in absolute knowledge---i.e., in the
 **complete identity of consciousness and object**" (364)

 But this Gadamer says is an error: "Experience stands in an
 ineluctable opposition to knowledge ... The truth of experience
 always implies an **orientation toward new experience**" (364)

 **the historical nature of man essentially implies a fundamental
 negativity that emerges in the relation between experience and
 insight** (364)

 Gadamer returns to Aeschylus: "learning through suffering" [pathei
 mathos] (365)

 "What a man has to learn through suffering is not this or that
 particular thing, but insight into the limitations of humanity, into
 the absoluteness of the barrier that separates man from the divine"
 (365)

 **experience is experience of human finitude** (365)

 *Experience teaches us to acknowledge the real. The genuine result of
 experience, then---as of all desire to know---is to know what is*
 (365)

 **Real experience is that whereby man becomes aware of his finiteness.
 In it are discovered the limits of the power and the self-knowledge of
 his planning reason** (365)

 "all the expectation and planning of finite beings is finite and
 limited. Genuine experience is experience of one's own historicity"
 (366)

 So, what is *hermeneutical experience?*

 "Hermeneutical experience is concerned with *tradition.* This is what
 is to be experienced. But tradition is not simply a process that
 experience teaches us to know and govern; it is *language---*i.e., it
 expresses itself like a Thou" (366)

 "A Thou is not an object; it relates itself to us" (366)

 So, Gadamer interrogates the "*experience of the Thou*" (366)

 There are three ways of interpreting or understanding the Thou: 1)
 understanding "human nature", i.e., with an eye to *prediction of
 behaviour* (366), 2) understanding the other and so *mastering him,*
 robbing him of his claim to legitimacy and keeping the other at a
 distance (this is the *historical consciousness* discussed before that
 seeks "objectivity" in its understanding) (368), and lastly, and here
 is Gadamer's position, 3) "**to experience the Thou truly as a
 Thou---i.e., not to overlook his claim but to let him really say
 something to us**" (369)

 This last position highlights the fact that "Belonging together always
 also means being able to listen to one another. When two people
 understand each other, this does not mean that one person
 "understands" the other"---it is finding understanding *together* in
 the *inbetween* (369)

 "Openness to the other, then, involves recognizing that I myself must
 accept some things that are against me, even though no one else forces
 me to do so" (369). This is **application**

 The hermeneutical or historically effected consciousness is
 characterized by a "**readiness for experience**" (370)

 Gadamer goes on to discuss the nature of this *readiness*

<br>

#### 4.3.3 The Hermeneutic Priority of the Question

##### 4.3.3.1 The Model of Platonic Dialectic

 The readiness of HEC indicates the "*logical structure of openness*
 that characterizes hermeneutical consciousness" (370)

 This is to say that, Gadamer's HEC, what the hermeneutical
 consciousness *should be,* is always ready for new experience, and is,
 as such, fundamentally *open*

 This openness is characterized by the "**structure of the question**"
 modeled in Plato's dialogues, and this structure is, for Gadamer,
 "**implicit in all experience**" (370)

 **We cannot have experiences without asking questions** (370). We must
 remember that these experiences (Erfahrung) are experiences in which
 *expectation is thwarted* (364)---i.e., our past experience is
 *negated*---and so we come to a more *comprehensive knowledge* of what
 is real. This sort of experience cannot occur without the *openness of
 the question*

 Openness in experience is the "openness of being either this or that"
 (370)

 **the logical form of the question and the negativity that is part of
 it culminate in a radical negativity: the knowledge of not knowing**
 (370)

 This is the Socratic "docta ignorantia" (371)

 Gadamer goes on to "consider *the essence of the question*" (371)

 "In order to be able to ask [truly ask, not to prove oneself right],
 one must want to know, and that means knowing that one does not know"
 (371)

 "there is a profound recognition of the *priority of the question* in
 all knowledge and discourse that really reveals something of an
 object"---i.e., knowledge that reveals something *true* (371)

 "The openness of a question is not boundless. It is limited by the
 horizon of the question ... **Posing a question implies openness but
 also limitation**" (372)

 Medieval dialectic "depends on the inner connection between knowledge
 and dialectic---i.e., between answer and question" (373)

 Following Aristole, Gadamer argues that "Knowledge always means,
 precisely, considering opposites. Its superiority over preconceived
 opinion consists in the fact that it is able to conceive of
 possibilities as possibilities" (373)

 **Knowledge is dialectical from the ground up** (373)

 Again with Socrates: "All questioning and desire to know presuppose a
 knowledge that one does not know; so much so, indeed, that a
 particular lack of knowledge leads to a particular question" (374)

 **the negativity of experience implies a question** (375)

 "dialectic proves its value because only the person who knows how to
 ask questions is able to persist in his questioning, which involves
 being able to preserve his orientation toward openness. The art of
 questioning is the art of questioning ever further---i.e., **the art
 of thinking**. It is called dialectic because it [the art of
 thinking] is the art of conducting a real dialogue" (375)

 Real dialogue requires that we "ensur[e] that the other person is
 with us" (375)

 "To conduct a conversation means to allow oneself to be conducted by
 the subject matter to which the partners in the dialogue are
 oriented"---that is, the *understanding* that lies *between* the two,
 the understanding which the two *come to share,* not one of the other
 (375)

 Thus, the **art of thinking** which is the **art of real dialogue** is
 an **art of testing** (375)

 *questioning makes the object and all its possibilities fluid* (376)

 "Dialectic ... is not the art of arguing ... but the art of
 thinking" (376)

 "The speaker ... is put to the question ... until the truth of what
 is under discussion ... finally emerges" (376)

 So if *hermeneutic experience* is characterized by *openness,* and
 *openness* by *the structure of the question,* and *the structure of
 the question* by *the consideration of opposites,* and *the
 consideration of opposites* is the *art of dialectic,* then
 hermeneutic experience is, indeed, ***dialectical***

 And dialectic, the art of dialogue, is characterized by language
 because "dialogue [is] spoken in language" (376). Therefore,
 language "performs the communication of meaning that, with respect to
 the written tradition, is the task of hermeneutics" (376)

 Hermeneutics is, *in fact,* the "task" of "entering into dialogue with
 the text" (376)

<br>

##### 4.3.3.2 The Logic of Question and Answer

 So, the "hermeneutic phenomenon ... implies the **primacy of
 dialogue** and the **structure of question and answer**" (378)

 **interpretation always involves a relation to the question that is
 asked of the interpreter** (378), which means that, to "understand a
 text" require us to obtain the "*horizon of the question*" (378)

 Every *text* is an answer to a *question,* and so Gadamer essentially
 argues, following Collingwood, that because *history is a sort of
 text,* that historical *events* are answers to the *questions* of
 human plans---i.e., human determinations in the face of the
 indeterminacy and openness of experience

 "The voice that speaks to us from the past---whether text, work,
 trace---itself poses a question and places our meaning in openness"
 (382)

 "A reconstructed question can never stand within its original horizon:
 for the historical horizon that circumscribed the reconstruction is
 not a truly comprehensive one. It is, rather, included within the
 horizon that embraces us as the questioners who have been encountered
 by the traditionary word" (382)

 So we must "go beyond mere reconstruction" (382), for "the text must
 be understood as an answer to a real question" (383)

 The "real and fundamental nature of a question" is thus "to make
 things indeterminate" (383), because, to truly understand a question,
 and thus the text which poses it, we must be *open* to it, which means
 we must recognize its validity, and so also recognize the potential
 *invalidity* of our own meanings

 Questioning is the "testing of possibilities" (383)

 **A person who thinks must ask himself questions** (383)

 *To understand a question means to ask it. To understand meaning is to
 understand it as the answer to a question* (383)

 "understanding philosophical texts always requires **re-cognizing what
 is cognized in them**" (384)

 "The dialectic of question and answer disclosed in the structure of
 hermeneutical experience now permits us to state more exactly what
 kind of consciousness historically effected consciousness is" (385)

 Understanding is a "reciprocal relationship of the same kind as
 conversation" (385)

 "We who are attempting to understand must ourselves make [the text]
 speak. But we found that this kind of understanding, "making the text
 speak," is not an arbitrary procedure that we undertake on our own
 initiative but that, as a question, it is related to the answer that
 is expected in the text" (385)

 "Anticipating an answer itself presupposes that the questioner is part
 of the tradition and regards himself as addressed by it" (385)

 *It is the historically effected consciousness that, by renouncing the
 chimera of perfect enlightenment* [total unity of self and object
 through infinite knowledge], *is open to the experience of history*
 (385)

 "We described its [HEC's] realization as the fusion of the horizons
 of understanding, which is what mediates between the text and its
 interpreter" (385)

 Gadamer advances: this fusion is in fact the "*achievement of
 language*" (386)

 In the next section he will go on to "approach the mystery of
 language" that is "so uncannily near our thinking" through the
 "conversation that we ourselves are" [i.e., through our being as
 dialoging, questioning, understanding, interpreting beings] (386)

 "understanding of the subject matter must take the form of language
 ... the way understanding occurs ... is the **coming-into-language**
 of the thing itself" (386)

 *Every conversation presupposes a common language, or better, creates
 a common language. Something is placed in the center, as the Greeks
 say, which the partners in dialogue both share, and concerning which
 they can exchange ideas with one another. Hence reaching an
 understanding on the subject matter of a conversation necessarily
 means that a common language must first be worked out in the
 conversation* (386)

 "To **reach an understanding in a dialogue** is not merely a matter of
 putting oneself forward and successfully asserting one's own point of
 view, but being **transformed into a communion** in which we do not
 remain what we were" (387)

# Part Three: The Ontological Shift of Hermeneutics Guided by Language

## 5 Language and Hermeneutics

### 5.1 Language as the Medium of Hermeneutic Experience

 "the more genuine a conversation is, the less its conduct lies within
 the will of either partner ... we fall into conversation ...
 Understanding or its failure is like an event that happens to us ...
 the language in which [conversation] is conducted bears its own
 truth within it---i.e., that it allows something to "emerge" which
 henceforth exists" (401)

 *To understand what a person says is, as we saw, to come to an
 understanding about the subject matter* (401)

 We cannot "get inside another person and relive his experiences
 (Erlebnisse)"---we can only understand what is between us, what is
 common, which Gadamer calls the "subject matter" of our understanding,
 which is experience, or a text in the case of hermeneutics (401)

 Now, Gadamer reminds us that "understanding always includes
 application," and extends this by noting that "*this whole process is
 verbal*" (402)

 We see this in translation because "every translation is at the same
 time an interpretation" (402)

 In this we see that "language as the medium of understanding must be
 consciously created by an explicit mediation" (402)

 So when there is *true* understanding "there is not translation but
 speech ... For you understand a language by living in it ... the
 hermeneutical problem concerns not the correct mastery of language but
 coming to a proper understanding about the subject matter, which takes
 place in the medium of language" (403)

 *Conversation is a process of coming to an understanding* ... [in
 which] *each person open himself to the other* ... [and to] *what
 he says ... so that we can be at one with each other on the subject*
 (403)

 "the common subject matter is what binds the two partners, the text
 and the interpreter, to each other" (406)

 This understanding of the subject matter requires a "fusion of
 horizon" which Gadamer now says "takes place in conversation, in which
 something is expressed that is not only mine or my author's, but
 common" (406)

 Because this occurs in conversation, then, Gadamer is able to say that
 "*language is the universal medium in which understanding occurs.
 Understanding occurs in interpreting*" (407)

 "Thus the hermeneutical phenomenon proves to be a special case of the
 general relationship between thinking and speaking ... Like
 conversation, interpretation is a circle closed by the dialectic of
 question and answer. It is a genuine historical life comportment
 achieved through the medium of language, and we can call it a
 conversation with respect to the interpretation of texts as well"
 (407)

 **The linguisticality of understanding is the *concretion of historically effected consciousness**(407)

<br>

#### 5.1.1 Language as Determination of the Hermeneutic Object

 *Linguistic tradition is tradition in the proper sense of the
 word---i.e., something handed down* ... *What has come down to us by
 way of verbal tradition is not left over but given to us, told us*
 (408)

 "In the form of **writing**, all tradition is contemporaneous with
 each present time" (408)

 "The ideality of the word is what raises everything linguistic beyond
 the finitude and transience that characterize other remnants of past
 existence" (408)

 **written texts present the real hermeneutical task** (409)

 "Writing is self-alienation. Overcoming it, reading the text, is thus
 the highest task of understanding" (409)

 "A reading consciousness is necessarily a historical consciousness and
 communicates freely with historical tradition" (409)

 After Hegel, Gadamer says that "history begins with the emergence of a
 will to hand things down, "to make memory last"" (409)

 "only a written tradition can detach itself from the mere continuance
 of the vestiges of apst life, remants from which one human being can
 by inference piece out another's existence" (409)

 The "capacity" of speech/language/the verbal for "being written down
 is based on the fact that speech itself shares in the pure ideality of
 the meaning that communicates itself in it" (410)

 **Writing is the abstract ideality of language** (410)

 "The understanding of something written is not a repetition of
 something past but the sharing of a present meaning" (410)

 "The reader experiences what is addressed to him and what he
 understands in all its validity. What he understands is always more
 than an unfamiliar opinion: it is always **possible truth**" (412)

 **Everything written is, in fact, the paradigmatic object of
 hermeneutics** (413)

 "understanding is not a psychic transposition. The horizon of
 understanding cannot be limited either by what the writer originally
 had in mind or by the horizon of the person to whom the text was
 originally addressed" (413)

 So not Barthes, but not historicism either.

 *What is fixed in writing has detached itself from the contingency of
 its origin and its author and made itself free for new relationships*
 (413)

<br>

#### 5.1.2 Language as Determination of the Hermeneutic Act

 "understanding itself has a fundamental connection with language"
 (414)

 "understanding is already interpretation because it creates the
 hermeneutical horizon within which the meaning of a text comes into
 force" (414)

 "we must translate [a text] into our own language ... [and] this
 involves relating it to the whole complex of possible meanings in
 which we linguistically move" (414)

 "*To think historically* means, in fact, *to perform the transposition
 that the concepts of the past undergo* when we try to think them. To
 think historically always involves mediating between those ideas and
 one's own thinking" (415)

 **To interpret means precisely to bring one's own preconceptions into
 play so that the text's meaning can really be made to speak for us**
 (415)

 "every interpretation includes the possibility of a relationship with
 others. There can be no speaking that does not bind the speaker and
 the person spoken to" ($16)

 **the interpretive process of understanding ... is simply the concretion of the meaning itself**(416)

 "Reading fundamentally involves interpretation" because reading, like
 drama or music as seen in part one, "awakens a text and brings it into
 new immediacy" (417)

 *Interpreting music or a play by performing it is not basically
 different from understanding a text by reading it: understanding
 always includes interpretation* (417)

 The artist's self-understanding "disappears again as an interpretation
 and preserves its truth in the immediacy of understanding" (418)

 **understanding is always a genuine event** (418)

 This is why understanding is *immediate* or has the character of
 *immediacy,* even though it is also *reflective*

 **Language is the language of reason itself** (420)

 This "makes language so close to reason---which means, to the things
 [reason] names---that one may ask why there should be different
 languages at all, since all seem to have the same proximity to reason
 and to objects" (420)

 But the reality of different languages "shows the superior
 universality with which reason rises above the limitations of any
 given language" (420)

 *The intimate unity of language and thought is the premise from which
 linguistics too starts. It is this alone that has made it a science*
 (421)

 Gadamer starts from this *intimate unity* and heads "in the opposite
 direction" (421). "Despite the multiplicity of ways of speech, we are
 trying to keep in mind the indissoluble **unity of thought and
 language** as we encounter it in the hermeneutical phenomenon, namely
 as the **unity of understanding and interpretation**" (421)

 Signs are not *instruments*---they are part of the process of *concept
 formation* which is a constantly "ongoing process" (421)

 "we must recognize that all understanding is interwove with concepts
 and reject any theory that does not accept the intimate **unity of**
 **word and subject matter**" (421-422)

 Language is not just a *form* (422)

 It is never "simply an object but instead comprehends everything that
 can ever be an object ... The language that lives in speech---which
 comprehends all understanding, including that of the interpreter of
 texts---is so much bound up with thinking and interpreting that we
 have too little left if we ignore the actual content of what languages
 hand down to us and try to consider language only as form" (423)

<br>

### 5.2 The Development of the Concept of Language in the History of Western Thought

#### 5.2.1 Language and Logos

 The Greek's began with the "intimate unity of word and thing,"
 considering the "true name" of a thing to be "part of the bearer of
 name" (423)

 The Greek *onoma* "means "name," and especially "proper name"" (423)

 "The word is understood primarily as a name ... It belongs to its
 bearer" (423)

 "Greek philosophy more or less began with the insight that a word is
 *only* a name---i.e., that it **does not represent true being**" (423)

 "Thereby the word changed from presenting the thing to substituting
 for it" (424)

 The whole debate is captured by Plato's *Cratylus*

 Two polar theories: *conventionalist* and *naturalist*

 Conventionalist: "unambiguous linguistic usage [is] reached by
 agreement and practice" (424)

 Naturalist: there is a "natural agreement between word and object that
 is described by the idea of correctness (orthotes)" (424)

 "the limit of *conventionalism* is that we cannot arbitrarily change
 the meaning of words if there is to be *language* ... Language always
 presupposes a common world" (424)

 "The limitation of the *similarity theory* [naturalist] is also
 clear. We cannot look at the things referred to a criticize the words
 for not correctly representing them" (424)

 Regardless, "**Language is not a mere tool we use**" (425)

 Gadamer's problem with both theories is that they "start from the
 existence and instrumentality of words ... Thus they start too late"
 (425). He wants to know **from** **where does the subject matter
 emerge**?

 Similarly, "Plato wants to demonstrate that no truth (aletheia ton
 onton) can be attained in language ... being must be known purely
 from itself" (425)

 It is Plato's *dialectic* "which aims to achieve this ... to make
 thought dependent on itself alone and to open it to its true objects,
 the "ideas," so that the power of words ... and their demonic
 technologization in sophistical argument are overcome" (425)

 Plato's knowledge is not "without words" but rather considers the
 "adequacy of the word" to be determined by the "knowledge of the thing
 it refers to" (425)

 This, Gadamer says, is "Plato avoid[ing] considering the real
 relationship between words and things" (425)

 "The pure thought of [Plato's] ideas, dianoia, is silent, for it is
 a dialogue of the soul with itself (aneu phones). The logos is the
 stream that flows from this thought and sounds out through the mouth"
 (425)

 "Plato undoubtedly did not consider the fact that the process of
 thought, if conceived as a dialogue of the soul, itself involves a
 connection with language" (425)

 *The net result, then, is that Plato's discovery of the ideas conceals
 the true nature of language even more than the theories of the
 Sophists, who developed their own art (techne) in the use and abuse of
 language* (426)

 "The specific way of dealing with the thing that we are concerned with
 here is that of making the thing meant apparent. The word is correct
 if it brings the thing to presentation (Darstellung)---i.e., if it is
 a representation (mimesis)" (428)

 Because our use of words "assumes that words have real meanings," even
 if we use the *wrong* word, it is still the *right* word for something
 else. "Thus we may speak of an *absolute perfection of the word,*
 inasmuch as there is no perceptible relationship---i.e., no
 gap---between its appearance to the senses and its meaning" (428)

 Gadamer's use of "relationship" and "gap" here are significant. For
 Plato, because words are *copies* of the *original,* there is a gap
 between them. This gap is also a *relation.* But as Gadamer shows,
 there is no *relation* between a word's "appearance to the senses"
 (i.e., its sound) and its meaning. And yet, word's *mean,* and can
 mean *correctly* (i.e., be the "correct" word for an object, even if
 used *incorrectly*), and thus their meanings seem to perfectly occur
 with their appearances. There is no relation; thus, there is no gap.

 There "is no reason why Cratylus should allow himself to be subjected
 to the yoke of the schema of original and copy" (429)

 So, as Gadamer points out, when Socrates says, in the *Cratylus,* that
 "words, unlike pictures (zoa), can be not only correct but true
 (alethe)" it is "like the revelation of a wholly obscured truth" (429)

 *The "truth" of a word does not depend on its correctness, its
 **correct adequation to the thing.** It lies rather in its perfect
 intellectuality---i.e., the manifestness of the word's meaning in its
 sound* (429)

 **In this sense all words are "true"---i.e., their being is wholly
 absorbed in their meaning---whereas a copy is only more or less
 similar and thus, judged by reference to the appearance of the
 original, only more or less correctly** (429)

 For Plato, the Sophists do not understand the "capacity for truth" of
 words (429). Where we have words, we have the knowledge of the thing
 behind to be discovered by the dialectician; but where we knowledge,
 we must build up that knowledge out of words. So "all this misses the
 point that **the truth of things resides in discourse**---which means,
 ultimately, in intending a unitary meaning concerning things---and not
 in the individual words, not even in a language's entire stock of
 words" (429-430)

 "Thus the **relational ordering** that is **logos** is much more than
 the mere correspondence of words and things, as is ultimately assumed
 in the Eleatic doctrine of being and in the copy theory. The truth
 contained in the logos is not that of mere perception (of noein), not
 just letting being appear; rather, it always **places being in a
 relationship**, assigning something to it. For precisely this reason,
 it is not the word (onoma) but the logos that is the bearer of truth
 (and also error). From this it necessarily follows that being
 expressed, and thus being bound to language, is quite secondary to the
 **system of relations** within which logos articulates and interprets
 the thing. We see that it is *not word but number* that is the real
 paradigm of the noetic: number, whose name is obviously pure
 convention and whose "exactitude" consists in the fact that every
 number is defined by its place in the series, so that is is a pure
 structure of intelligibility, an ens rationis, not in the weak sense
 of a being-validity but in the strong sense of perfect rationality.
 This is the real conclusion to which the *Cratylus* is drawn, and it
 has one very important consequence, which in fact influences all
 further thinking about language" (430)

 So what Gadamer is getting at is that Plato, in the *Cratylus,* puts
 forward two extremes: the *constructivist* and the *naturalist*
 theories of language. We know this from p. 425: "in showing the two
 extreme positions to be untenable, Plato is questioning a
 presupposition common to them both ... *Plato wants to demonstrate
 that no truth (aletheia ton onton) can be attained in language*."
 Plato works Cratylus into a corner by forcing him to pick between two
 "untenable" positions. And what we can see to be Plato's actual
 position is that there is a truth that seems to *inhere* in language
 that emanates from the true being of the thing, its form, beyond. But
 the essentially false dichotomy of the *Cratylus* led to a softening
 of the extremes, and thus the *conventional* (constructivist) argument
 becomes the dominant. It is the only way to explain Plato's dialectic
 within the dichotomy he established. This is the point Gadamer thinks
 has been missed. Plato's ideas aren't even operating within his
 dialectic. But what we have is an overcoming of the old Greek primacy
 of the *word* (*onoma*) by the *sign* (*semeion*).

 "the *word,* just like the number, becomes the mere *sign* of a being
 that is well defined and hence preknown" (430)

 "we are not starting from the thing and inquiring into the being of
 the word as a means of conveying it. Rather, beginning from the word
 as a means, we are asking what and how it communicates to the person
 who uses it" (430)

 The ***sign*** "has its being only in application, and so its "self"
 consists only in pointing to something "other"" (430)

 It must be "taken as a sign, in order for its own being as an object
 to be superseded and for it to dissolve (disappear) into its meaning.
 It is the abstraction of pointing itself" (431)

 *A sign, then, is not something that insists on its own content* (431)

 A sign "does not have its absolute significance within itself---i.e.,
 the subject is not superseded in it ... only on the basis of its own
 immediate being is it at the same time something referential, ideal"
 (431)

 Then there is the ***copy***

 In the copy the "thing copied is itself represented, caught, and made
 present" (431)

 So, as the *Cratylus* shows, the copy theory is impossible because
 words are in no way copies of things, and the pure convention of signs
 is, for Gadamer, not satisfying, because it does not explain the
 *fittedness* of the sign to its thing. But because readers of the
 *Cratylus* did not perceive Plato's position, the "discussion of
 language ever since" has centred on the "sign (semeion or semainon)"
 rather than on the "image (eikon)" [which is related to the copy
 theory]

 With this turn, "**thought is so independent of the being of
 words---which thought takes as mere signs through which what is
 referred to, the idea, the thing, is brought into view---that the word
 is reduced to a wholly secondary relation to the thing**" (432)

 Gadamer has beef with symbolic logic and instrumental theories of
 language

 For Gadamer, "language is something other than a mere sign system
 denoting the totality of objects" (434)

 **A word is not just a sign** (434)

 *Wedged in between image and sign, the being of language could only be
 reduced to the level of pure sign* (435)

 Yet for Gadamer, there is something of the *copy* or *image* in the
 word, along with something of the *sign*

<br>

#### 5.2.2 Language and Verbum

 *Incarnation is not embodiment* (436)

 Christ is not the *appearance* of man, like the Greek gods, but
 *became man* (436)

 "If the Word became flesh and if it is only in the incarnation that
 spirit is fully realized, then the logos is freed from its
 spirituality, which means, at the same time, from its cosmic
 potentiality" (436)

 *in contrast to the Greek logos, the word is pure event* (437)

 "the mystery of this unity [of the Trinity] is reflected in the
 phenomenon of language" (437)

 The Fathers "initially ... tried to make use of the Stoic antithesis
 of the inner and outer logos ... This distinction was originally
 intended to distinguish the Stoic world principle of the logos from
 the externality of merely repeating a word" (437)

 *The analogy between the inner and the outer word, speaking the word
 aloud in the vox, now acquires an exemplary value* (437)

 The "act of becoming" that is creation by the Word and the incarnation
 of the Word is *not* "something turn[ing] into something else," nor
 "separating one thing from the other," nor "lessening the inner word
 by its emergence into exteriority," nor "becoming something different,
 so that the inner word is used up" (437)

 "The greater miracle of language lies not in the fact that the Word
 becomes flesh and emerges in external being, but that that which
 emerges and externalizes itself in utterance is always already a word"
 (437)

 The true word, the *verbum cordis,* the inner word (as opposed to the
 outer word expressed in a particular tongue), is "the mirror and the
 image of the divine Word" (438)

 "The mystery of the Trinity is mirrored in the miracle of language
 insoafar as the word that is true, because it says what the thing is,
 is nothing by itself and does not seek to be anything ... **It has
 its being in its revealing**" (438)

 *The inner mental word is just as consubstantial with thought as is
 God the Son with God the Father* (438)

 So Gadamer argues that the ""language of reason" [i.e., symbolic
 language, pure language, etc.] is not a special language" (439)

 The "bond to language cannot be superseded" (439). For the
 scholastics, *logos* is translated as both *ratio* and *verbum.* The
 Word is not just reason.

 For St. Thomas "the word still has the ontological character of an
 event. The inner word remains related to its possible utterance. While
 it is being conceived by the intellect, the subject matter is at the
 same time ordered toward being uttered ... the inner word ... **is
 the subject matter thought through to the end**" (440)

 Thus, Gadamer claims, the inner word is ***processual***

 "the inner word, by expressing thought, images the finiteness of our
 discursive understanding. Because our understanding does not
 comprehend what it knows in one single inclusive glance, it must
 always draw it thinks out of itself, and present it to itself as if in
 an inner dialogue with itself. In this sense **all thought is speaking
 to oneself**" (440)

 But this *process* is not *successive* in the mind, but
 ***emanative***

 "In the process of emanation, that from which something flows, the
 One, is not deprived or depleted" (441). This is true of the emanation
 of the Spirit, and it is "likewise true of the mental emergence that
 takes place in the process of thought, speaking to oneself" (441)

 So this *process of emanation* is a "total remaining within oneself"
 (441)

 "the process and emergence of thought is not a process of change ...
 not a transition from potentiality into action, but an **emergence**"
 (441)

 "The word is not formed only after the act of knowledge has been
 completed"---i.e., after *ratio* has been carried out to its
 completion---but is "**the act of knowledge itself**" (441)

 The *word* and the *forming of the intellect* are **simultaneous**
 (441)

 In the omniscience of the divine Word, this processual element is
 incomprehensible (441-442)

 Gadamer writes, then, that "Creation is not a real process, but only
 interprets the structure of the universe in a temporal scheme" (442)

 So in this difference from the divine, Gadamer elaborates the
 "processual element in the word" (442)

1.  "**the human word is potential before it is actualized**"; it begins
    with "an emanation" from "memory" into mind. The work of the mind
    begins here, and its "real movement" is toward the "perfect
    expression of its thoughts." Thus the "perfect word ... is formed
    only in thinking." Once so, the "**thing is then present in it**"
    (442)

2.  "**the human word is essentially incomplete**. No human word can
    express our mind completely." So because the thing is *brought to
    presence in the word,* but the "human mind" is never completely
    present to itself, "it follows that the human word is not one, like
    the divine word, but must necessarily be many words." The human mind
    "needs the multiplicity of words. It does not really know what it
    knows" (443)

3.  "**every thought that we think** ... **is a mere accident of the
    mind**." This is because the "word of human thought is directed
    toward the thing, but it cannot contain it as a whole within
    itself." Thus, thought always *proceeds* in its *process.*

 All of this is for Gadamer to say that the "inner unity of thinking
 and speaking to oneself ... *is not formed by a reflective act*"
 (443)

 *there is no reflection when the word is formed, for the word is not
 expressing the mind but the thing intended* [i.e., the subject
 matter] (444)

 "The subject matter that is thought ... and the word belong as
 closely together as possible. Their unity is so close that the word
 does not occupy a second place in the mind beside the "species"
 (Lat.); rather, the word is that in which knowledge is
 consummated---i.e., that in which the species is fully thought" (444)

 "unity and multiplicity are fundamentally in dialectical relationship
 to each other" (444)

 **The meaning of the word cannot be detached from the event of
 proclamation** (444)

 So:

1.  "Plato recognized that the human word is essentially
    discursive---i.e., that the association of a multiplicity of words
    expresses one meaning" (445)

2.  "Aristotle demonstrated the logical structure of the proposition,
    the judgment, the syllogism, and the argument" (445)

3.  Gadamer: "The unity of the word that explicates itself in the
    multiplicity of words manifests something that is not covered by the
    structure of logic and that brings out the *character of language as
    event:* the *process of concept formation*" (445)

 Gadamer is bad at making points. What's the point in all of this? I
 think what he's doing is to try and get at the quality of *image* or
 *copy* that the word possesses, as he concludes in the previous
 section. Yes, the word is a sign, but it does not "dissolve" into the
 "abstraction" of "pointing." The word *insists on its content,*
 whereas a pure sign does not. This insistence is, in part, like the
 insistence of the image or the copy. It draws attention to itself.

 So in discussing the *verbum,* Gadamer shows how this insistence *is,*
 how the meaning of the word is not just in *pointing* to the thing,
 but is *brought to presence, concretized,* or *formed* in the word
 itself. We cannot access the "thing" through pure *ratio* (reason or
 logic), and then just describe it imperfectly with words. Rather, our
 *reason* is entirely bound up with words. Our *thinking through* is
 *ordered toward* thought's expression in the word, even if that
 expression is to oneself. Thus, the verbum and its relation to the
 Trinity is significant. In the Trinity, we see the union of Father,
 Son, Spirit, and with the Son, we see the union of Divine and Flesh,
 the incarnation. But in the incarnation, where God *became* Man,
 nothing of his being was lost. In the same way, the inner word is
 cosubstantial with thought, and in its expression through the word,
 thought is, as it were, *made flesh,* and so consummated, *brought
 into presence,* which is not a *lessening* or a *separating* but a
 *culmination.*

 Thus Plato is significant because he shows that *the human word is
 essentially discursive,* which is why Gadamer discusses him in the
 previous section.

 But Gadamer demonstrates why we must move beyond Plato and the
 dialectic of *constructivist* vs *naturalist* that he established.
 There is a truth *in* the word, and that is the presencing of the
 thing to mind in the word. Things are only brought to knowledge
 through the word.

 This the *character of language as event.* It is the *process* of
 *bringing to knowledge* or *bringing to mind* of the *thing* through
 the *word.*

<br>

#### 5.2.3 Language and Concept Formation

 "natural concept formation ... often takes place as a result of
 accidents and relations" (445)

 So if language is an event, and that event is that of *concept
 formation,* then the event often happens by *accident*

 The movement Gadamer makes here is this: "*when the Greek idea of
 logic is penetrated by Christian theology, something new is born: the
 medium of language, in which the mediation of the incarnation event
 achieves its full truth*" (445)

 We see this incarnated mediation in the "person who speaks---who, that
 is to say, uses the general meanings of words---is so oriented toward
 the particularity of what he is perceiving that everything he says
 acquires a share in the particularity of the circumstances he is
 considering" (446)

 *But that means, on the other hand, that the general concept meant by
 the word is **enriched** by an any given perception of a thing, so
 that what emerges is a new, more specific word formation which does
 more justice to the particularity of the act of perception. However
 certainly speaking implies using pre-established words with general
 meanings, at the same time, a constant process of concept formation is
 going on, by means of which the life a language develops* (446)

 Gadamer wants to show that "verbal consciousness" is far from "logical
 schema." Certainly it follows certain logical rules---specifically,
 similarity and difference---but these rules are more accidents of
 particular experience than of the subsumption of consciousness to
 rules

 Verbal consciousness has a **fundamental metaphorical nature** (446)

 *the particularity of an experience finds expression in metaphorical
 transference* (446)

 Plato calls us to rise "above names" and find the "truth of the
 thing"---but this "does not mean that thinking can dispense with the
 use of name and logos ... Plato always recognized that these
 intermediaries are necessary" (447)

 But, just "as individual words acquire their meaning and relative
 unambiguity only in the unity of discourse, so the true knowledge of
 being can be achieved only in the whole of the relational structure of
 the ideas" (447)

 So, then, we need to know the *whole* of this structure to know being

 "Transference [analogy] from one sphere to another not only has a
 logical function; it corresponds to the fundamental metaphoricity of
 language" (448)

 "The well-known stylistic figure of metaphor is only the rhetorical
 form of this universal---both linguistic and logical---generative
 principle" (448)

 "according to Aristotle the formation of concepts by language
 possesses a perfectly undogmatic freedom, for experiencing similarity
 among the things one encounters, which then leads to a universal, is
 merely a preliminary achievement: it stands at the beginning of
 science but is not yet science" (449)

 "What originally constituted the basis of the life of language and its
 logical productivity, the spontaneous and inventive seeking out of
 similarities by means of which it is possible to order things, is now
 marginalized and instrumentalized into a rhetorical figure called
 metaphor" (449)

 Christian theology moves beyond this: "the word is a **process** in
 which the **unity of what is meant is fully expressed**" (45))

 "The word is for [Cusa] no less than the mind itself, not a
 diminished or weakened manifestation of it" (451)

 "Accordingly, the multiplicity in which the human mind unfolds itself
 is not a mere fall from true unity and not a loss of its home. Rather,
 there has to be a positive justification for the finitude of the human
 mind, however much this finitude remains related to the infinite unity
 of absolute being" (451)

 "Suddenly it is of positive significance that things can be
 articulated in various ways (though not in any way at all) according
 to their similarities and their differences" (452)

 "languages as they have grown up historically, with their history of
 meanings, their grammar and their syntax, can be seen as the **varied
 forms of a logic of experience, of natural---i.e.,
 historical---experience**" (452)

 "The articulation of words and things that each language performs in
 its own way always constitutes a primary natural way of forming
 concepts that is much different from the system of scientific concept
 formation. It exclusively follows the human aspect of things, the
 system of man's needs and interests. What a linguistic community
 regards as important about a thing can be given the same name as other
 things that are perhaps of a quite different nature in other respects,
 so long as they all have the same quality that is important to the
 community" (452)

 *it is always artificial and contrary to the nature of language to
 measure the contingency of natural concept formation against the true
 order of things and to see the former as purely accidental* (453)

 **This contingency comes about, in fact, through the human mind's
 necessary and legitimate range of variation in articulating the
 essential order of things** (453)

 Cusa's theory "starts ... from the fundamental inexactness of all
 human knowledge" (454)

 "Every expression is fitting (congruum), but not every one is exact
 (precisum)" (454)

 Cusa's "theory of language presupposes not that the things (formae) to
 which the words are attached belong to a pre-established order of
 original models that human knowledge is gradually approaching, but
 that **this order is created by differentiation and combination out of
 the given nature of things**" (454)

 "This kind of essential inexactness can be overcome only if the mind
 rises to the infinite" [we might say here, the *whole*]

 Okay, let's clarify again.

 In 1) Language and Logos, Gadamer details the beginnings of the
 science of language with the Greeks, and the fundamental flaw of the
 dialectic that Plato establishes, constructivist vs. naturalist. Words
 do not *naturally* mean, but neither are they pure *convention.* They
 exist somewhere in the middle, almost as images.

 Then in 2) Language and Verbum, Gadamer shows how the Scholastic
 adoption of Greek *logos* philosophy, and its fusion with the Word
 from the Gospel of John, changed the perspective. In the incarnation,
 pure Spirit *emerges,* is *concretized,* in the Word made flesh. That
 which was "inner" (Spirit) becomes "outer" (Flesh). The Word was
 always the Word, but it was brought to presence in this emergence.
 Thus, with some loopy logic, Gadamer claims that language is the same.
 The word is the *process* of language, of knowledge formation.
 Knowledge is brought to presence in the word. This is the *event* of
 language. Language is not just a thing, an object, but an *event*
 and/or *process* that brings to mind (to knowledge) the thing that is
 perceived. The thing is *concretized* in knowledge by its speaking.
 This is the *image* quality of the word. As an image it *brings to
 presence* the thing represented.

 This leads to 3) Language and Concept Formation. This concretization
 is *concept formation.* The concept is formed by the word. Gadamer
 goes through Plato, Aristotle, and finally Nicholas of Cusa to show
 this progression. Basically, language does not come from logic but
 logic from language. Language is *contingent.* The thing perceived is
 brought to mind by the word that seem most fitting (similar) to it.
 This word is already given. But in its use by the speaker in his
 particularity, the word forms a concept (knowledge) in the speaker's
 mind, which then informs the use of that word in the future. The
 contingency and particularity of difference and combination, the
 *multiplicity* of it, is not a hindrance but *productive.* The order
 of things is *created* by this multiplicity.

### 5.3 Language as Horizon of a Hermeneutic Ontology

#### 5.3.1 Language as Experience of the World

 These various ways of thinking about language "are remote from the
 modern philosophy and science of language" (455)

 Wilhelm von Humboldt: "there exists an indissoluble connection between
 individuality and universal nature. Together with the feeling of
 individuality, the sense of a totality is given as well" (456)

 Humboldt: "Wherever there is language, the ordinary verbal power of
 the human mind is at work, and every language is capable of attaining
 the general goal toward which this natural power of man is directed"
 (456)

 "his normative interest in comparing the structure of human languages
 does not get in the way of acknowledging the individuality---and that
 means the relative perfection---of each language" (456)

 "he investigated the *inner form* in which the **originary event** of
 human language formation is, in each instance [of language],
 differentiated" (456)

 This is thus "*abstraction down to form*" (457), from the ideal of
 *inner form* to the *differentiation of language*

 "language is "really situated in relation to an infinite and truly
 boundless sphere, the epitome of everything that can be thought. Thus
 it must make an infinite use of finite means and is able to do so
 through the identity of the faculty that generates thoughts and
 language"" (457)

 "The actual essence of a faculty that is aware of itself is to be able
 to make infinite use of finite means" (457)

 "as the formalism of a faculty, it [the linguistic faculty] can
 always be detached from the determinate content of what is said" (457)

 But for Gadamer, "*[v]erbal form and traditionary content cannot be
 separated in the hermeneutic experience*" (457)

 "If every language is a view of the world, it is so not primarily
 because it is a particular type of language (in the way that linguists
 view language) but because of what is **said** or **handed down** in
 this language" (458)

 "However thoroughly one may adopt a foreign frame of mind, one still
 does not forget one's worldview and language-view. Rather, the other
 world we encounter is not only foregin but is also **related to us.**
 It has not only its own truth *in itself* but also its own **truth for
 us**" (458)

 Language is never "simply an object of research and knowledge" (458)

 "The hermeneutical experience ... means nothing else than to be in a
 position to accept what is said in it as said to oneself" (459)

 "understanding always means that what is said has a claim over one,
 and this is impossible if one's own "worldview and language-view" is
 not also involved" (459)

 Humboldt: "language was human from its very beginning" (459)

 *Language is not just one of man's possessions in the world; rather,
 on it depends the fact that man has a* world *at all* (459)

 "The world as world exists for man as for no other creature that is in
 the world" (459)

 This world is **verbal in nature** (459)

 *language has no independent life apart from the world that comes to
 language within it* (459)

 **Not only is the world world only insofar as it comes into language,
 but language, too, has its real being only in the fact that the world
 is presented in it. Thus, that language is originarily human means at
 the same time that man's being-in-the-world is primordially
 linguistic** (459)

 To *have* a world is to have an *orientation to it* to *have an
 orienbtation* is to *keep oneself free from and present to oneself the
 world* this is done through language

 One is embedded in one's environment; one is oriented toward one's
 world

 "man's relationship to the world is characterized by *freedom from
 environment.* This freedom implies the linguistic constitution of the
 world" (460)

 "wherever language and men exist, there is not only a freedom from the
 pressure of the world, but this freedom from the environment is also
 freedom in relation to the names that we give things" (460)

 "Man's freedom in relation to the environment is the reason for his
 free capacity for speech and also for the historical multiplicity of
 human speech in relation to the one world" (461)

 "rising above the environment means *rising to "world"* itself, to
 true environment" (461)

 "Animals do not have this variability when making themselves
 understood to one another. This means, ontologically, that they make
 themselves understood, but not about matters of fact, the epitome of
 which is the world" (461)

 *Whereas the call of animals induces particular behaviour in the
 members of the species, men's coming to a linguistic understanding
 with one another through the logos reveals the existent itself* (461)

 "It is matters of fact ... that come into language" (461)

 With the Greeks, "What is conceived of as existing is not really the
 *object* of statements, but it "comes to language in statements." It
 thereby acquires its truth, its being evident in human thought"

 **GREAT DEFINITION BY GADAMER OF HIS TRUTH: "BEING EVIDENT"**

 "Thus Greek ontology is based on the factualness of language, in that
 it conceives the essence of language in terms of statements" (462)

 However, "language" *also* "has its true being only in dialogue, in
 *coming to an understanding*" (462)

 "Coming to an understanding as such ... is a life process in which a
 community of life is lived out" (462)

 Human language is unique because in it ""world" is disclosed" (462)

 "the world is the common ground [the subject matter]" which those in
 dialogue must come to understand (462)

 *the verbal world in which we live is not a barrier that prevents
 knowledge of being-in-itself but fundamentally embraces everything in
 which our insight can be enlarged and deepened* (463)

 "the infinite perfectibility of the human experience of the world
 means that, whatever language we use, we never succeed in seeing
 anything but an ever more extended aspect, a "view" of the world"
 (464)

 "the fact that our experience of the world is bound to language does
 not imply an exclusiveness of perspectives" but rather a wealth of
 perspectives into which we can grow (464)

 "The consciousness of being conditioned does not supersede our
 conditionedness" (465)

 But also, "what we see with our eyes has genuine reality for us" (465)

 "the truth that science states is itself **relative to a particular
 world orientation** and cannot at all claim to be the whole" (465)

 "the immediacy of our worldview and view of ourselves, in which we
 persist, is preserved and altered within language because we finite
 beings always come from afar and stretch into that distance" (466)

 Language "is not a creation of reflective thought, but itself helps to
 fashion the world orientation in which we live" (466)

 **in language the world itself presents itself** (466)

 "Verbal experience of the world is "absolute." It **transcends all the
 relative ways being is posited** because it embraces all
 being-in-itself, in whatever relationships (relativities) it appears"
 (466)

 Whereas science ignores these relationships. "Each science, as a
 science, has in advance projected a field of objects such that to know
 them is to govern them" (468)

 *The world that appears in language and is constituted by it does not
 have, in the same sense, being-in-itself, and is not relative in the
 same sense as the object of the natural sciences. It is not
 being-in-itself, insofar as it is not characterized by objectivity and
 can never be given in experience as the comprehensive whole that it
 is* (468)

 **[E]very language has a direct relationship to the infinity of
 beings** (469)

 *To have language involves a mode of being* (469)

 "If we keep this in mind, we will no longer confuse the factualness
 (Sachlichkeit) of language with the *objectivity (Objektivitat) of
 science*" (469)

 The Greek's had a "**positive connection between the factualness of
 language and man's capacity for science**" (470)

 Whereas "Modern theory is a tool of construction by means of which we
 gather experiences together in a unified way and make it possible to
 dominate them. We are said to "construct" a theory" (470)

 *Ancient theoria is not a means in the same sense, but the end itself,
 the highest manner of being human* (470)

 ""Theory" in the ancient sense, however, is something quite different.
 There it is not just that existing orders as such are contemplated,
 but "theory" means sharing in the total order itself" (471)

 *This difference between Greek theoria and modern science is based, in
 my opinion, on different orientations to* verbal experience of the
 world (471)

 Greek knowledge was "**within language**" (471) whereas modern
 knowledge makes language an object and is concerned with what is
 "**present-at-hand**" (471)

 *Our starting point is that verbally constituted experience of the
 world expresses not what is present-at-hand, that which is calculated
 or measured, but what exists, what man recognizes as existent and
 significant* (472)

 "As little as "world" is *objectified* in language, so little is
 historical effect the *object* of hermeneutical consciousness" (472)

<br>

#### 5.3.2 Language as Medium and its Speculative Structure

 "That human experience of the world is linguistic in nature was the
 thread underlying Greek metaphysics in its thinking about being since
 Plato's "flight into the logoi"" (472)

 For the Greeks, the "being of beings" is a "being that fulfilled
 itself in thought" (472)

 This thought "is the thought of nous" [intellect], which is "the
 highest and most perfect being, gathering within itself the being of
 all beings" (472)

 The "articulation of the logos brings the structure of being into
 language, and this coming into language is, for Greek thought, nothing
 other than the presenting of the being itself, its aletheia" (473)

 Thought is fulfilled in the "infinity of this presence" (473)

 Gadamer wants to **move beyond** this "splendid self-forgetfulness"
 (473)

 Gadamer is guided by the "*finitude of our historical experience*"
 (473)

 *It is the medium of language alone that, related to the totality of
 beings, mediates the finite, historical nature of man to himself and
 to the world* (473)

 The "dialectical puzzle of the one and many" first in Plato and then
 in medieval theology now finds "its true and fundamental ground" (473)

 The *occasionality* of "human speech is not a casual imperfection of
 its expressive power; it is, rather, the logical expression of the
 living virtuality of speech that brings a totality of meaning into
 play, without being able to express it totally" (474)

 **All human speaking is finite in such a way that there is laid up
 within it an infinity of meaning to be explicated and laid out** (474)

 Also: "the interpreter *belongs* to his text" (474)

 *Belonging* (in classical metaphysics) "refers to the transcendental
 relationship between being and truth" (474)

 *knowledge [is] an element of being itself* (474)

 But "the critique of the verbalism of Aristotelian and Scholastic
 science that we touched on above dissolved the old co-ordination
 between man and world that lays at the basis of logos philosophy"
 (475)

 So refutation of this position, and then the overcoming of the
 refutation, is the "role" of "*dialectic*" in Gadamer's work here. He
 wants to return to the "co-ordination" of "man and world" but in a new
 way

 This "testifies to the continuity of the problem from its Greek
 origin" (476)

 *Dialectic, this expression of the logos, was not for the Greeks a
 movement performed by thought; what thought experiences is the
 movement of the thing itself* (476)

 This helps Gadamer approach the question of the "interconnection of
 event and understanding" (477)

 So: "the concept of belonging is no longer regarded as the
 teleological relation of the mind to the ontological structure of what
 exists" (477)

 Instead, the key is that "**something exists**" (477)

 So: *occurrence* "means that [the interpreter] is not a knower
 seeking an object, "discovering" by methodological means what was
 really meant and what the situation actually was, though slightly
 hindered and affected by his own prejudices" (477) ... [actually]
 "occurrence is made possible only because the word that has come down
 to us **as tradition** and to which we are to listen really encounters
 us and does so as if it addressed us and **is concerned with us**"
 (477)

 This is **the logic of the question** (477)

 *the hermeneutical occurrence is realized in the dialectic of the
 question* (477)

 "For on the other side [of the subject], that of the "object," this
 occurrence means the coming into play, the playing out, of the content
 of tradition in its constantly widening possibilities of significance
 and resonance extended by the different people receiving it" (477-78)

 So since we're dealing with the *question,* "we must take account of
 the particular dialectic implied in *hearing*" (478)

 "**he who is addressed must hear**" (478)

 You can look away, but "you cannot "hear away"" (478)

 *hearing is an avenue to the whole because it is able to listen to the
 logos* (478)

 *Belonging is brought about by tradition's addressing us* (478)

 "The mode of being of tradition is ... language" (479)

 "This linguistic communication between present and tradition is, as we
 have shown, the event that takes place in all understanding" (479)

 "the hermeneutical event proper is not language as language, whether
 as grammar or as lexicon; it consists in the coming into language of
 what has been said in the tradition: an event that is at once
 appropriation of interpretation" (479)

 "**this event is not our action upon the thing, but the act of the
 thing itself**" (479)

 For the Greeks, the "true method was an action of the thing itself"
 (479)

 So, "thinking means unfolding what consistently follows from the
 subject matter itself" (480)

 "**the thing itself** ... **asserts its force**" (480)

 "That things change and become their opposite as one consistently
 thinks them through, that thought acquires the power of "testing what
 follows from contraries, without knowing the what," is the experience
 of thought **Hegel** appeals to when he conceives of **method as the
 self-unfolding of pure thought** to become the systematic whole of
 truth" (480)

 For Gadamer, the *hermeneutical experience* has "something resembling
 [this] dialectic ... an activity of the thing itself, an action
 that, unlike the methodology of modern science, is **a passion, an
 understanding, an event that happens to one**" (481)

 "The hermeneutical experience also has its own rigor: that of
 **uninterrupted listening**" (481)

 "A thing does not present itself to the hermeneutical experience
 without an effort special to it, namely that of "being negative toward
 itself." A person who is trying to understand a text has to **keep
 something at a distance**---namely everything that suggests itself, on
 the basis of his prejudices, as the meaning expected---as soon as it
 is rejected by the sense of the text itself" (481)

 *The movement of the interpretation is dialectical not primarily
 because the one-sidedness of every statement can be balanced by
 another side ... but because the word that interpretively fits the
 meaning of the text expresses the whole of this meaning---i.e., allows
 **an infinity of meaning to be represented within it in a finite way**(481)

 This dialectic is different from Plato and Hegel

 What is in common is the **SPECULATIVE ELEMENT**

 This refers to the *mirror relation* (481)

 "Being reflected involves a **constant substitution** of one thing for
 another"

 "When something is reflected in something else ... it means that the
 [mirror] **throws back** the image"

 "The mirror image is **essentially connected** with the **actual
 sight** of the thing through the **medium of the observer**"

 "It has **no being of its own**; it is like an "appearance" that is
 not itself and **yet** **allows the thing to appear** by means of a
 mirror image"

 "It is like a duplication that is still **only the one thing**" (482)

 "The real mystery of a reflection is the intangibility of the image,
 the **sheer reproduction** hovering before the mind's eye" (482)

 Thus, *speculative,* is derived from this "notion of reflection in a
 mirror" (482)

 "a thought is speculative if the relationship it asserts is not
 conceived as a quality unambiguously assigned to a subject, a property
 to a given thing, but must be thought of as a mirroring, in which the
 reflection is nothing but the pure appearance of what is reflected,
 just as the one is the one of the other, and other is the other of the
 one" (482)

 With Hegel, *speculation* took the form of *proposition* (482)

 But, "the form of the proposition destroys itself since the
 speculative proposition does not state something about something;
 rather, it presents the unity of the concept" (482).

 "For Hegel the important thing it to *represent expressly* this inner
 block [of the subject moving into the predicate and becoming a
 concept] that thought undergoes" (483)

 "The speculative relation, then, must pass into dialectical
 presentation" (483)

 "The **dialectical** is the **expression** of the **speculative**"
 (484)

 But all of this depends, as Plato, on "subordinating language to the
 "statement"" (484)

 **Language** itself, however, **has something speculative** about it
 in a quite different sense---not only in the sense Hegel intends, as
 an instinctive prefiguring of logical reflection---but, rather, as the
 **realization of meaning**, as the **event of speech**, of
 **mediation**, of **coming to an understanding*** (484)

 This is speculative because "the finite possibilities of the word are
 oriented toward the sense intended as toward the infinite" (485)

 *To say what one means, on the other hand---to make oneself
 understood---means to hold what is said together with an infinity of
 what is not said in one unified meaning and to ensure that it is
 understood in this way ... Someone who speaks is behaving
 speculatively when his words do not reflect beings, but express a
 relation to the whole of being* (485)

 "the way tradition is understood and expressed ever anew in language
 is an event no less genuine than living conversation" (487)

 "The **hermeneutical relation** is a **speculative relation**, but it
 is fundamentally different from the dialectical self-unfolding of the
 mind, as described by Hegel's philosophical science" (487)

 "Since hermeneutic experience implies an event of language ... it too
 partakes of dialectic" (487)

 *interpretation shares in the discursiveness of the human mind, which
 is able to conceive the unity of the object only in successiveness*
 (487)

 "interpretation has the dialectical structure of all finite,
 historical being, insofar as every interpretation must begin somewhere
 and seeks to supersede the one-sidedness which that inevitably
 produces" (487)

 **hermeneutics has the task of revealing a totality of meaning in all
 its relations** (487)

 "the beginning of interpretation is, in fact, a response" to tradition
 handed down (488)

 "*Thus the dialectic of question and answer always precedes the
 dialectic of interpretation. It is what determines understanding as an
 event*" (488)

 "As the realization of the act of understanding [the word] is the
 actuality of the historically effected consciousness, and as such it
 is truly speculative: having no tangible being of its own and yet
 reflecting the image that is presented to it" (489)

 "the whole of our investigation is subsumed under this rubric": that
 "understanding is inseparable from language and that language is
 related to reason of every kind" (490)

<br>

#### 5.3.3 The Universal Aspect of Hermeneutics

 **Language is a medium where I and world meet** or, rather, manifest
 their original belonging together* (490)

 *this speculative medium that language is represents a **finite
 process** in contrast to the infinite dialectical mediation of
 concepts* (490)

 *the speculative structure of language emerged, not as the reflection
 of something given but as **the coming into language of a totality of
 meaning*** (490)

 *this activity of the thing itself, the coming into language of
 meaning, points to a **universal ontological structure**, namely to
 the basic nature of everything toward which understanding can be
 directed* (490)

 ***Being that can be understood is language*** (490)

 "everything that is language has a speculative unity: it contains a
 distinction, that between its being and its presentations of itself,
 but this is a distinction that is really not a distinction at all"
 (491)

 "the word is a word only because of what comes into language in it.
 Its own physical being exists only in order to disappear into what is
 said. Likewise, that which comes into language is not something that
 is pregiven before language; rather, the word gives it its own
 determinateness" (491)

 This what Part 1 and 2 (critique aesthetics and historical
 consciousness) were aiming at: the *speculative movement* (491)

 *man's relation to the world is absolutely and fundamentally verbal
 in nature, and hence intelligible ... hermeneutics is ... a*
 universal aspect of philosophy (491)

 "If we start from the fact that understanding is verbal, we are
 emphasizing, on the contrary, the finitude of the verbal event in
 which understanding is always in the process of being concretized"
 (492)

 Gadamer moves to the ***concept of the beautiful*** to conclude (493)

 *Beautiful things are those whose value is of itself evident* (493)

 "Hence the idea of the beautiful closely approximates that of the good
 ... insofar as it is something to be chosen for its own sake, as an
 end that subordinates everything else to it as a means" (494)

 The *beautiful* and the *good* "transcend everything that is
 conditional and multiform" (494)

 "Thus the order of being that consists in the orientation toward the
 one good agrees with the order of the beautiful" (494)

 In Plato: *measure, appropriateness, right proportion*

 Aristotle: *order, right proportions, definition*

 "Harmonious proportion, symmetry, is the decisive condition of all
 beauty" (495)

 Beauty has a "*special advantage*" (496)---verses the good, the
 beautiful "of itself presents itself ... its being is such that it
 makes it makes itself immediately evident" (497)

 "The beautiful appears not only in what is visibly present to the
 senses, but it does so in such a way that it really exists only
 through it---i.e., emerges as one out of the whole" (497)

 "The beautiful is of itself truly "most radiant"" (497)

 ""**Radiance**," then, is not only one of the qualities of the
 beautiful but constitutes its actual being" (498)

 "Beauty is not simply symmetry but appearance itself. It is related to
 the idea of "shining" ... "To shine" means to shine on something, and
 so to make that on which the light falls appear. **Beauty has the mode
 of being of *light***" (498)

 "the beauty of a beautiful thing appears in it as light, as a
 radiance" (498)

 "by making something else visible, [light] is visible itself, and it
 is not visible in any other way than by making something else visible"
 (498)

 This is the **reflective nature of light** (498)

 "The light that causes everything to emerge in such a way that it is
 evident and comprehensible in itself is the light of the word" (499)

 *Thus the close relationship that exists between the shining forth
 ... of the beautiful and the evidentness ... of the understandable
 is based on the metaphysics of light* (499)

 "Only when light is created does God *speak* for the first time.
 Augustine interprets this speech, by means of which light is commanded
 and created, as the coming into being of mental light, by means of
 which the difference among created things is made possible. It is only
 through light that the formlessness of the first created mass of
 heaven and earth is rendered capable of being shaped into a
 multiplicity of forms" (499)

 "**being is self-presentation**" and "**all understanding is an
 event**" (500)

 "the beautiful and the mode of being of understanding have the
 character of an **event**" (500)

 "the hermeneutical experience, as the experience of traditionary
 meaning, has a share in the ***immediacy*** which has always
 distinguished the experience of the beautiful, as it has that of all
 **evidence** of *truth*" (500)

 *when something speaks to us from tradition ... there is something
 evident about what is said, though that does not imply it is, in every
 detail, secured, judged, and decided. The **tradition asserts its own
 truth** in being understood* (501)

 **The event of the beautiful and the hermeneutical process both
 presuppose the finiteness of human life** (501)

 *"*being is *language---i.e., self-presentation*" (502)

 "the event-character of the beautiful" || "the event-structure of
 all understanding"

 "Just as the mode of being of the beautiful proved to be
 characteristic of being in general, so the same thing can be shown to
 be true of the *concept of truth*" (502)

 **The beautiful, the way in which goodness appears, reveals itself in
 its being: it presents itself. What presents itself in this way is not
 different from itself in presenting itself** (503)

 "the beautiful must always be understood ontologically as an "image""
 (503)

 Truth is "**at play in understanding**" (504)

 "the words that bring something into language are themselves a
 speculative event. Their truth lies in what is said in them, and not
 in an intention locked in the impotence of subjective particularity"
 (504)

 "In using words what is given to the senses is not put at our disposal
 as an individual case of a universal; it is itself made present in
 what is said---just as the idea of the beautiful is present in what is
 beautiful" (505)

 *What we mean by truth here can best be defined again in terms of our
 concept of* play (505)

 "The weight of the things we encounter in understanding plays itself
 out in a linguistic event, a play of words playing around and about
 what is meant. *Language games* exist where we as learners ... rise
 to the understanding of the world" (505)

 Remember, **it is the game itself that plays, for it draws the players into itself** (505)

 It is "the play of language itself, which addresses us, proposes and
 withdraws, ask and fulfills itself in the answer" (505)

 *Someone who understands is always already drawn into an event through
 which meaning asserts itself* (506)

 *When we understand a text, what is meaningful in it captivates us
 just as the beautiful captivates us. It has asserted itself and
 captivated us before we can come to ourselves and be in a position to
 test the claim to meaning that it makes. What we encounter in the
 experience of the beautiful and in understanding the meaning of
 tradition really has something of the **truth of play** about it. In
 understanding we are drawn into an event of truth and arrive, as it
 were, too late, if we want to know what we are supposed believe* (506)

 Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics is a "discipline of questioning
 and inquiring, a discipline that guarantees truth" (506)
