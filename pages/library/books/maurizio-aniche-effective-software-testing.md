#### Abstract

"Effective Software Testing teaches you a systematic approach to software testing that will ensure the quality of your code. It’s full of techniques drawn from proven research in software engineering, and each chapter puts a new technique into practice. Follow the real-world use cases and detailed code samples, and you’ll soon be engineering tests that find bugs in edge cases and parts of code you’d never think of testing! Along the way, you’ll develop an intuition for testing that can save years of learning by trial and error."
