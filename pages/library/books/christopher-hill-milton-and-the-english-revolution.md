### Abstract

> "In this remarkable book Christopher Hill used the learning gathered in a lifetime’s study of seventeenth-century England to carry out a major reassessment of Milton as man, politician, poet, and religious thinker. The result is a Milton very different from most popular representations: instead of a gloomy, sexless “Puritan”, we have a dashingly thinker, branded with the contemporary reputation of a libertine."
