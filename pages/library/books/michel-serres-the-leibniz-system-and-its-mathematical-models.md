### Abstract

> "There is a strange reference to a re-translation (re-publication?) of this translation of Serres’s doctoral thesis, translated by Bill Ross for Clinamen originally in 2003 (see [9781903083178](https://www.abebooks.com/9781903083178/System-Leibniz-Philosophy-Science-Michel-1903083176/plp) on AbeBooks).

> It appears that Bill Ross was the founder of Clinamen, but his [author page](https://edinburghuniversitypress.com/bill-ross/) at Edinburgh University Press indicates that he passed in 2022."
