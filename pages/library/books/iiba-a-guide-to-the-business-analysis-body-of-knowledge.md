"A Guide to the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge(R) (BABOK(R) Guide) is the only globally recognized standard of practice for business analysis. Developed through a rigorous consensus-driven standards process, the BABOK(R) Guide incorporates the collective wisdom and experience of experts in the field from around the world.

Whether you are considering starting a career in business analysis, or you are an experienced professional in the field, the BABOK(R) Guide is your key resource to help you and your stakeholders discover opportunities for business success, deliver successful organizational change, and create business value."
