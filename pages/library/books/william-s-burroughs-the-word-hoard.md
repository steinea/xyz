### Citation

Burroughs, William S. *The Word Hoard.* 1954-1958. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Word_Hoard>.

### Abstract

> "*The Word Hoard* was a large body of text (approximately 1000 typewriter pages) produced by author William S. Burroughs between roughly 1954 and 1958.

> Material from the word hoard was the basis for *Naked Lunch* and the *Interzone* collection, as well as much of *The Soft Machine* and minor parts of *Nova Express* and *The Ticket That Exploded*. Central to the "Word Hoard" was the 200-page "Interzone" manuscript that Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac and Alan Ansen helped organise and type in Tangier in spring 1957, and which became, with later additions, *Naked Lunch* in 1959."
