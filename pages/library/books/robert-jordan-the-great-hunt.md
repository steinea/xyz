### Abstract

> "For centuries, gleemen have told the tales of The Great Hunt of the Horn. So many tales about each of the Hunters, and so many Hunters to tell of... Now the Horn itself is found: the Horn of Valere long thought only legend, the Horn which will raise the dead heroes of the ages. And it is stolen. In pursuit of the thieves, Rand al’Thor is determined to keep the Horn out of the grasp of The Dark One. But he has also learned that he is The Dragon Reborn—the Champion of Light destined to stand against the Shadow time and again. It is a duty and a destiny that requires Rand to uncover and master extraordinary capabilities he never imagined he possessed. Since its debut in 1990, The Wheel of Time® has captivated millions of readers around the globe with its scope, originality, and compelling characters. The last six books in series were all instant #1 New York Times bestsellers, and The Eye of the World was named one of America's best-loved novels by PBS's The Great American Read."

### Annotations

"Ba'alzamon. In the Trolloc tongue, it meant Heart of the Dark, and even unbelievers knew it was the Trolloc name for the Great Lord of the Dark. He Whose Name Must Not Be Uttered. Not the True Name, Shai'tan, but still forbidden" (21)

"Already a bend is forming in the Pattern" (22)

"All the stories are real" (53)

"Loial shook his head. 'Whether you hear it or not, it is still true. The Wheel of Time weaves the Pattern of the Age, using the lives of men for thread. And you three are ta'veren, centerpoints of the weaving'" (57)

"The Prophecies must be fulfilled. We were taught that they will be, and must be, and yet that fulfillment is treason to everything else we were taught" (83)

"The Pattern pays no heed to human plans" (84)

"The Pattern demands a Dragon because the Pattern weaves toward Tarmon Gai'don" (86)

"The Pattern does not demand a Dragon, but the one true Dragon" (86)

"He has no more control over his fate than a candle wick has over the flame" (89)

"Prophecies from the Shadow, dark prophecies, had an unfortunate way of being fulfilled as well as prophecies from the Light" (119)

"Is it old come again, or new?" (162)

Wilders have difficulties, it is tru"e. Almost always they have built up walls to keep themselves from knowing what it was they were doing, and those walls interfere with conscious control" (208)

"You must surrender to the Power before you can control it" (211)

"Most of it sounded like this. 'If a woman go left, or right, does Time's flow divide? Does the Wheel then weave two Patterns? A thousand, for each of her turnings? As many as the stars? Is one real, the others merely shadows and reflections?'" (219)

"Everything is ... linked, Rand. Whether it lives or not, whether it thinks or not, everything that is, fits to gether. The tree does not think, but it is part of the whole, and the whole has a---a feeling. I can't explain any more than I can explain what being happy is, but.... Rand, this land was glad for a weapon to be made. Glad!" (236)

"The Aes Sedai, some of them, studied worlds like this, and that study was the basis of how they grew the Ways" (255)

"Those worlds this one, all the others-are reflections of the real world, she says. This one seems pale to us because it is a weak reflection, a world that had little chance of ever being. Others are almost as likely as ours. Those are as solid as our world, and have people. The same people, she says, Rand. Imagine it! You could go to one of them and meet yourself. The Pattern has infinite variation, she says, and every variation that can be, will be" (255)

"'The Oneness,' she said, sounding satisfied. She saw his questioning look and added, 'That is what it is called ... in some places. The Oneness. To learn the full use of it, it is best to wrap it around you continuously, to dwell in it at all times, or so I've heard'" (256)

"'There was a book written about these worlds,' she said tightly. 'Mirrors of the Wheel'" (256)

"It had seemed as if he were truly alive then, sickliness and all, and now was only an imitation" (261)

"She traced one symbol, a little larger than the others, with a finger. A triangle standing on its point inside a circle. 'This stands for the true world, our world'" (262)

"Saidin sang, and the sphere pulsed---even without looking, he could feel it-and the thought came that if he sang the song saidin sang, that huge stone face would open its mouth and sing with him. With him and with saidin. All one" (295)

"The Pattern takes everything into the weaving" (319)

"That we swear these oaths, that we are known to be bound, allows the nations to deal with us without fearing that we will throw up our own power, the One Power, against them" (322)

"Ter'angreal are what must concern you, now. We don't know why they were made. We dare use only a handful of them, and the ways in which we do dare to use them may be nothing like the purposes the makers intended" (322)

"The light was everywhere. The light was everything" (324)

"Dimly, she remembered playing mazes on paper as a child, there had a trick to finding your way out, but she could not bring it to mind. Everything in the past seemed vague, as if it had happened to someone else" (325)

"She shivered again. 'Was it real?'
<br>'No one knows,' Sheriam replied" (328)

"The ancients said there were many worlds. Perhaps this ter'angreal takes you to them" (329)

"Sheriam Sedai says that with the Red Ajah hunting down men who could channel for three thousand years, we are culling the ability to channel out of us all" (343)

"the greatest feats of the Age of Legends required men and women working together with the Power" (345)

"my water is yours" (389)

*Commentator's Note: So we're cloning Fremen now?*

"This Rhuidean. What is it? Where is it? How are the girls chosen to go?" (390)

"Rhuidean lies in the lands of the Jenn Aiel, the thirteenth clan" (390)

"He Who Comes With the Dawn" (391)

*Commentator's Note: Or the Lisan al Gain, Voice from the Outer World, perhaps?*

"He will go to Rhuidean, and lead us out of the Three-fold Land" (391)

"Does the Wheel of Time weave threads into the Pat tern of which we know nothing? Or does the Dark One touch the Pattern again?" (392)

"'The Wheel of Time weaves us all into the Pattern as it wills,' Verin said, looking at the parchments, 'but sometimes it provides what we need before we know we need it'" (429)

"Hurin stared at him. 'But, Lord Ingtar, that isn't the way. What happens, happens, and what is meant to be, will' Ingtar's glare cut him off ... though he still muttered under his breath, 'It isn't the way, talking of 'must'" (430)

"The mounted Shienaran soldiers spread out in a loose circle around the Stone and those afoot. 'We stood it upright,' Alar said, 'when we found it many years ago, but we did not move it. It... seemed to . . . resist being moved.' She went right up to it, and laid a big hand on the Stone. 'I have always thought of it as a symbol of what has been lost, what has been forgotten. In the Age of Legends, it could be studied and somewhat understood. To us, it is only stone'" (492)

"The symbols on the top half of the Stone stand for worlds. Not all the Worlds That Might Be, of course Apparently, not every Stone connects to every world, and the Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends believed that there were possible worlds no Stones at all touched. Do you see nothing that sparks a memory?" (494)

"The symbols at the bottom indicate Stones at other places. If you know the trick of it, you could take us, not to this same Stone in another world, but to one of those others there, or even to one of them here. It was something akin to Traveling, I think, but just as no one remembers how to Travel, no one remembers the trick. Without that knowledge, trying it might easily destroy us all" (494)

"'The Lines that join the Worlds That Might Be, laid by those who knew the Numbers of Chaos.' Verin shuddered; she seemed to be talking to herself. 'I've never heard it, but there is no reason we would not be born in those worlds, yet the lives we lived would be different lives. Of course. Different lives for the different ways things might have happened'" (501)

"Oddly, she felt almost as if he were not there any longer, as if he had ceased to exist" (506)

*Commentator's Note: In the portal stone.*

"You cannot run from saidar" (509)

"Elaida says the rules of nature do not hold in the Ways. At least, not the way they do outside" (524)

"'That isn't the way,' Hurin said softly. 'Not must. What happens, happens.' No one paid him any mind" (547)

"'The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills,' Verin said placidly. 'With ta'veren, what happens is what was meant to happen. It may be the Pattern demanded these extra days. The Pattern puts everything in its place precisely, and when we try to alter it, especially if ta'veren are involved, the weaving changes to put us back into the Pattern as we were meant to be'" (577)

"But men of ten mistake revenge and killing for justice. They seldom have the stomach for justice" (604)

"He knew their faces, knew their names. But he heard a hundred names when he looked at each face, some so different he did not recognize them as names at all, though he knew they were" (615)

"Only a few are bound to the Wheel, spun out again and again to work the will of the Wheel in the Pattern of the Ages" (615)

"'Time?' Birgitte said, smiling. 'We have all of time'" (616)

"The Wheel spins us out for its purposes, not ours, to serve the Pattern. I know you, if you do not know yourself" (616)

"'The Pattern weaves itself around our necks like halters,' Artur Hawkwing said. 'You are here. The banner is here. The weave of this moment is set. We have come to the Horn, but we must follow the banner. And the Dragon'" (616)

"Rand felt a calmness beyond that of the void. 'I will never serve you, Father of Lies. In a thousand lives, I never have. I know that. I'm sure of it Come. It is time to die'" (620)
