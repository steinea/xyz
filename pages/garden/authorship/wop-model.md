"There’s endless ways to work on games-adjacent texts and projects. This one is mine.

I’ve been adopting the WOP model for releasing projects. In the WOP model, independent publishers choose to release three broad editions of our works: Web, Offline, and Physical, in roughly that order.

The rest of this post will set some context then elaborate on each edition in turn.

There are a few things I think are true about games-adjacent texts when it comes to independent production.

1. Everyone has a limited budget.
2. Everyone has limited time.
3. Everyone has limited skills.
4. Everyone has differing accessibility needs.
5. Everyone has differing aesthetic preferences.
6. Digital formats aren’t physical formats.
7. Reference texts aren’t teaching texts.
8. Production can be iterative rather than incremental.

I’m not going to belabor the first five points. If you aren’t limited by budget, time, or skill, good for you. If you think that accessibility is one-size-fits-all, you’re wrong and I encourage you to use a search engine. If you think everyone shares the same aesthetic preferences, I encourage you to talk to more people."
