The method uses the affordances of Git to track the design process of a project from initial concept through design through development (and iteration) through testing to release, support, and reception. Perhaps most centrally, Git commits are used not just to keep track of technical progress in the implementation of the project, but to track the design thinking behind each “move” made in the project. This is alongside a Process Journal that is used to capture more longform reflections about the project direction as a whole."
