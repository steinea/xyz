"Welcome to Aftermath, a worker-owned, reader-supported news site covering video games, the internet, and the cultures that surround them. You might remember most of us from Kotaku, where we broke news, covered events, and brought you hard-hitting investigations. You might also have seen us at Motherboard by Vice, The Verge and The Washington Postâ€™s games vertical Launcher. We got back together to start this site not just so we could all blog together again, but to try something new for ourselves and for games journalism."
