"Welcome to Crossplay, a community at the intersection of parenting and games. As a parent, the world of social media, technology, and video games is a scary and confusing place. I'm a reporter who's been covering video games for more than 20 years, and I'm also the parent of two kids. Crossplay is here to guide you through it. I’m Patrick Klepek, and for the past six years I’ve been a senior writer and reporter at Waypoint, a video game website that tried to speak honestly about games and culture. Over those same six years, I’ve also been navigating the world of parenting, and slowly watching, with equal parts dread and excitement, as my kids looking towards games. We, as parents, are in it together."
