"Welcome to Hit Points, a newsletter about the videogame industry by me, Nathan Brown. You may know me from my decade working on Edge magazine, including three years as editor; from my keynote interviews at the Develop conference; or from Twitter, in which case I can only apologise. These days I’m a game consultant and freelance writer. Hit Points tells you what’s happening in and around the game industry, why it’s happening, and why it matters. It is a spiritual successor to Big Picture Mode, the Edge column I wrote for five years that used print’s distance from the news cycle as an opportunity to step back, zoom out and consider the broader implications of the latest developments in games, and the business and culture that surround them. And maybe do some jokes while I’m at it. "
