"Remap is a new media company from the creators of the long-running video game website, Waypoint, and its popular adjoining podcast, Waypoint Radio. Join Rob Zacny, Cado Contreras, Patrick Klepek, and a rotating cast of friends as they set off on a new adventure that has them obsessing over the video game Dragonâ€™s Dogma nearly as much as they question the nature of capitalism."
