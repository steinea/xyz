"Weâ€™re Rascal, a new, independent, reader-supported, worker-owned outlet for journalism about tabletop roleplaying games and the people who make them. Rascal was co-founded by Lin Codega, Rowan Zeoli, and Chase Carter, writers and critics you might already know from other websites such as Gizmodo, Dicebreaker, Polygon, and elsewhere. We wanted to continue the vital work of investigating this industry while also building space for criticism, culture reporting and lighthearted blogs that wouldn't survive anywhere else."
