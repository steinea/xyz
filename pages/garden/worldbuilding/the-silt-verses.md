"Carpenter and Faulkner, two worshippers of an outlawed god, travel up the length of their deity’s great black river, searching for holy revelations amongst the reeds and the wetlands.

As their pilgrimage lengthens and the river’s mysteries deepen, the two acolytes find themselves under threat from a police manhunt, but also come into conflict with the weirder gods that have flourished in these forgotten rural territories.

This is a world where divine intervention takes place through prayer-markings scratched into stumping-posts, and offerings are left squirming to die in the flats of the delta.

This is a world of ritual, and hidden language, and sacrifice.

This is folk horror, and fantasy, and a dark road trip into the depths of unusual faith.

From the creators of the highly acclaimed I Am in Eskew, comes a new folk-horror audio drama. Initially the show focuses on two characters, but opens up to include a range of voice actors, multiple cities and towns in the world built specifically around this podcast."
