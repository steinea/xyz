"Welcome to the In Places Deep patreon.  You may be aware of my Old School D&D Blog, In Places Deep, and my long running megadungeon campaign, Nightwick Abbey. The purpose of this patreon - aside from giving an out of work guy a little cash - is to release parts of Nightwick Abbey in a playable format and to build towards a book of the first three levels.  Once this project is complete, other projects are likely to follow.

If you haven’t heard of Nightwick Abbey, it is a megadungeon built long ago by a holy order of knights who sought to purge the area around it of pagan devilry.  In their hubris they turned to wicked and vile acts and eventually had to be destroyed by the forces of the Realm of Man and the Church of Law. Today its ruins are said to be haunted by ghosts and devils, and much treasure is still said to lay inside.

Each month I’ll be doing one post a week, including monsters, treasures,  general dungeon features, character options, and usually culminating in one or more geomorphs from the dungeon.  These posts are laid out and illustrated by Chris Huth, who has played in Nightwick Abbey for almost 10 years, but we hope to add more artists to the project as it develops."
