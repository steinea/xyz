Details from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrophyRPG/comments/10ve6eu/the_scoundrels_quarter_trophy_campaign/):

"Hi all! In case anyone is interested, Jason Cordova is running me and a few others through a Trophy campaign using the Scoundrel's Quarter (which is in the Trophy Dark book). This will be a Trophy Gold campaign, but as part of the Devil's Bargains we can put the Scoundrel's Quarter in peril (it has its own ruin score!). Then, to lower the ruin of the Scoundrel's Quarter, we run a Trophy Dark incursion.

We're five sessions in, now, and have started our first Dark Incursion. It's a lot of fun if I do say so myself."
