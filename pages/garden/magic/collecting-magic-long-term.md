"Building a cube is a great way to take cards sitting in your collection and find a new use for them. The Cube format has a ton of variety built-in, as the themes and cards included are all up to the individual curating it."

...

"Instead of being a singleton format, a Set Cube mimics the experience of drafting an actual set or block from *Magic*'s past. To achieve this, it contains three to four of every common, two of every uncommon, and one of every rare card found in the chosen format."

...

"In a normal cube, cards are shuffled randomly into 15-card faux booster packs regardless of rarity. In a Set Cube, the cards are separated by rarity and sorted into packs following the normal rarity distribution of sealed booster packs."
