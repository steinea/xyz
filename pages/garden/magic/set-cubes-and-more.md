"Set Cubes – custom draft formats based on an official Magic expansion, block, or plane – are one of the easiest entry points to Cube. They can be a source of limitless free drafts or an opportunity to recreate or rebalance a favorite Draft format. They can be a way to scaffold the design process or an opportunity for a bespoke Cube built around a theme or plane."

Approaches:

* Recreating Your Favorite Limited Set
* Customizing a Set Cube
  * Excluding “Constructed Plants” and Feel-Bads
  * Excluding Rares & Mythics
  * Rebalancing Themes
  * Beyond a Single Set
  * Adding More Mana Fixing
* Set Cube as a Starting Point
* Plane and Theme Cubes

"Set cubes are versatile custom Limited formats with a deceptively large possibility space. On a spectrum from exact draft replicas to loosely inspired thematic formats, set cubes can address a wide set of gameplay goals."
