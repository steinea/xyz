"Demolish your enemies via an army of terrifying goats!!

**1: ACQUIRE ARMY OF GOATS**

Springjack Shepherd as our main source of GOATS. Use Cloudshift and Flickerwisp to blink your Shepherd for MORE GOATS.

Use Kithkin Harbinger to search for your Springjack Shepherd for MORE GOATS.

Stasis Snare, Oblivion Ring, Wall of Omens to keep you safe while you build up your ARMY OF GOATS, plus Wall of Omens helps you draw into MORE GOATS.

Trading Post and Springjack Pasture for MORE GOATS.

Soul Warden to heal you every time you get MORE GOATS.

**2: BUFF YOUR ARMY OF GOATS**

Intangible Virtue so your GOATS don't get TIRED and also they do MORE DAMAGE.

Obelisk of Urd choose GOATS, so your GOATS do MORE DAMAGE.

Nobilis of War a nice 5 white mana for Springjack Shepherd, but also FLAMING GOATS that do MORE DAMAGE.

Eldrazi Monument for FLYING, INDESTRUCTIBLE GOATS that do MORE DAMAGE.

**3: POSSIBLE CHANGES**

Benalish Marshal a recent release, good for multiple reasons, including being a 3 white mana for Springjack Shepherd while also giving your GOATS MORE DAMAGE.

Honor of the Pure, a possible replacement for Intangible Virtue. If used, your GOATS might now get TIRED when attacking, but your other creatures (ew) get MORE DAMAGE.

Coat of Arms so your ARMY OF GOATS does MORE DAMAGE.

Doom Cannon, Fodder Cannon: In case you ever wake up and feel like LOADING YOUR GOATS INTO CANNONS AND LAUNCHING THEM AT YOUR ENEMIES!

Skull Catapult for if instead you prefer LOADING YOUR GOATS INTO CATAPULTS AND LAUNCHING THEM AT YOUR ENEMIES!

Altar of Dementia in case you ever wake up and feel like SACRIFICING YOUR GOATS TO THE SUPREME GOAT GOD EMPEROR SO HE CAN MILL YOUR ENEMIES!"
