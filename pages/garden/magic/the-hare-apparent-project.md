"I’ve been slowly working on a self-guided project to build every commander with white in its color identity as a Hare Apparent deck. I am posting this here as not only a means to show you something I’ve recently been passionate about for a game I love, but also as an offer for any of those interested who wanna help out.

According to Scryfall there are 838 commanders with white in their identity. Meaning there are at least 838 ways to build a Hare apparent deck. If you wanna be part of quite possibly the biggest project like this on Moxfield, please reach out.

Rules are simple, build the deck you want with a commander that hasn’t been built yet, send me the deck link and I will import it into Moxfield. The goal is to have 1 deck of each commander. No set guideline on time.

Thank you all for your time and consideration reading this. Hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Keep it hoppin’!
