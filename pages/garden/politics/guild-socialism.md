"Guild socialism is a political movement advocating workers' control of industry through the medium of trade-related guilds 'in an implied contractual relationship with the public.' It originated in the United Kingdom and was at its most influential in the first quarter of the 20th century. It was strongly associated with G. D. H. Cole and influenced by the ideas of William Morris."
