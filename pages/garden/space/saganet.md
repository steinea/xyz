"Astrobiology is one of the greatest human endeavors. It combines the past several millennia of our explorations of our place in the universe and uses modern science and reasoning to help us try to figure out what life is, where it comes from, whether we’re alone, and what our future may be!

Astrobiology is a multidisciplinary realm of study that seeks to understand the origins, evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe. It combines the principles and methods of various scientific disciplines, such as biology, chemistry, astronomy, geology, and planetary science, along with other realms of study and thought such as philosophy, economics, history, communication, linguistics, cultural studies, Indigenous knowledge, and sociology — all to collectively address fundamental questions such as:

* How did life emerge on Earth, and what are the conditions that might be required for life to originate on other worlds?
* Could life exist on other planets or moons in our own solar system, such as Mars or Europa? What does the history of our explorations of these worlds teach us about ourselves as a species?
* What are the regions around other stars where we may be most likely to find habitable or inhabited worlds, and how common are habitable planets, moons, and other worlds in the universe?
* How can we detect signs of life on other planets and distinguish them from non-biological processes?
* What can the history and processes of our own civilization, such as cultural and technological developments, teach us about possibilities for alien life? If we meet an advanced alien intelligence one day, are we prepared for that meeting?

Astrobiologists study a range of environments that may host life, including extreme environments on Earth (such as deep sea hydrothermal vents and Antarctic dry valleys), as well as planets and moons within our solar system and exoplanets orbiting other stars. By studying these environments and searching for biosignatures (indicators of life) using various observational and analytical techniques, astrobiologists aim to understand the potential for life beyond Earth and its significance for our understanding of the universe and our place in it.

SAGANet is a proud part of the development of astrobiology through our community development, through our cultivation of resources for students and those interested in learning more about astrobiology, and through our articles and other endeavors that highlight the research and people in astrobiology (such as the Ask an Astrobiologist show)."
