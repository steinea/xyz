"Our research scientists engage in interdisciplinary research using virtual communication tools to collaborate and share ideas. We publish our research in academic journals, and we engage the public in thinking about science by sharing our research through various platforms such as [SAGANet](/saganet/).

We pursue scientific, historical, philosophical, and transdisciplinary perspectives of questions such as:

* How did life on Earth originate, and how long will Earth remain habitable for humans?
* What environmental analogues on Earth can help us understand the environments of other planets?
* How do human civilization and the Earth system co-evolve?
* What technologies allow the human civilization to co-exist with a dynamic planet?
* What human spaceflight models will be effective in short-term transportation of humans into low-Earth orbit as well as long-term travel to the Moon, Mars, and beyond?
* Has life ever developed on another planet in the Solar System?
* How unique is Earth among other planets in the galaxy."
