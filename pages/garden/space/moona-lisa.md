"In 1997, I remixed the Leonardo da Vinci’s famous painting Mona Lisa, into 142 perfectly spaced color beads placed at the intersections of an imaginary two-dimensional triangular network. Close up, the picture of the set of beads makes no sense, but if you see it from a distance you will perceive (or at least ‘guess’?) the portrait of Mona Lisa, the most famous Leonardo Da Vinci’s painting.

In 2021, I revamped my op art piece by replacing the beads with a palette of naturally colored Moons, captured by Italian astrophotographer Marcella Giulia Pace. The Moons’ colors are the result of atmospheric scattering, adding a unique, ‘celestial’ dimension to the artwork."
