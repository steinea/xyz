"NOTE: No More City was active throughout 2020 and 2021, and then we fell apart as collectives sometimes do. We published three issues. If you are looking for current writings from around this hellscape, you could check out Creeker Zine or BC-Counter Info.

We are an anarchist publication based out of so-­called vancouver. We are a collective of cats who live in the city because that’s where pals and projects are at. Meanwhile, we plug our ears through the constant car traffic and construction noise and breathe in asphalt fumes and car exhaust. We watch all of our favourite spaces disappear through gentrification and see fewer non­human animal friends every year. The city is life ­support. The city is death.

We are domesticated animals turning scruffy and crusty as we rummage for trash and search for friends in a crumbling city. Along the way, we stumble upon proof of lives lived, proof that others resisted and desired in a similar manner as we do. We follow their traces---evidence of times and places where friends found each other and their intensities and passions intersected in waves."
