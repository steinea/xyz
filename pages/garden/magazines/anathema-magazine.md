"Exceptional art is a bruise: it leaves its mark on you. At its best it leaves us vulnerable and raw, transformed by the experience. At Anathema we're interested in giving that exceptional work a home. Specifically the exceptional work of queer people of colour (POC)/Indigenous/Aboriginal creators. As practicing editors we're keenly aware of the structural and institutional racism that makes it hard for the work of marginalized writers to find a home."
