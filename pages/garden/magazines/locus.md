"Locus magazine was founded in 1968 in New York by Charles N. Brown, Ed Meskys, and Dave Vanderwerf as a one-page newszine to promote the “Boston in ’71” Worldcon bid. Two trial issues were sent to various fans and professionals to drum up subscriptions before issue #1 was mailed. Vanderwerf left after issue #4, and Meskys after #11, but Charles decided to keep the ‘zine going with the help of first wife Marsha Brown (who was co-editor from 1968-69), and later second wife Dena Brown (who co-edited from 1970-77). Issues were published once or twice a month, as the news merited."
