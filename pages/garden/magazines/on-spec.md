"In 1989, a small group of Edmonton writers formed The Copper Pig Writers Society in order to fill a niche in Canada–a paying market for English SF. SF with a uniquely Canadian Perspective. Of course this perspective is often defined by what it is NOT– fiction  expected by the average American audience. At least at the time when On Spec launched, Canadian writers of excellent short fiction were being turned down by the bigger markets because they simply did not fit the mold. They were too “alien”."
