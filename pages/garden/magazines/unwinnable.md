"Unwinnable is a website and digital magazine, founded in 2010 to provide a different kind of cultural criticism. We love to read about different perspectives, so we set out to collect a diverse group of contributors, amateur and veteran alike, to tell their stories. From the silly to the serious, we pride ourselves on providing a friendly, thoughtful venue for writing that is free of the constraints of traditional internet publishing."
