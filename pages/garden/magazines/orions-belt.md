"Orion’s Belt is the home of bold, experimental literary science fiction and fantasy. We want stories that make us think about our place in the universe and our relationships with each other. We want stories that blur the line between “genre” fiction and literary fiction. We want stories that reach toward the stars while never forgetting the people on the ground. And we want it all in under 1200 words. It’s a difficult challenge, but we have faith in you, fellow cosmonauts."
