"Inspired by the Dave Langford-led CHECKPOINT project some people became overenthusiastic and undertook a similar plan to web all of the late Ron Bennett's really quite legendary newszine SKYRACK. Yes, all 96 issues of it, from its start in April 1959 to the absolute end in July 1971. OK, not an enormous project, simply hours of scanning and OCR and some incredibly fast and accurate copy-typing from Ms Brialey."
