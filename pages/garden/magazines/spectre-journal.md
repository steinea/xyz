"How should we understand the self-activity of the working class as it actually exists?

How should the fact of difference – whether in terms of race, ethnicity, gender, sex, nationality, or something else entirely – impact our analyses of capitalism and strategies for bringing it to its long overdue end?

Spectre is a new Marxist journal that takes these questions as its point of departure. We aim to promote analysis, discussion, and debate on the revolutionary left, both in the United States and around the world, recovering the insights of Black radical thought, anti-colonial movements, socialist feminism, and queer theory for our politics. Only when the most oppressed sections of the working class are finally free can we consider human emancipation meaningful in any real sense."
