"Reactor (or, Reactor Magazine) is an online magazine and community site that covers science fiction and fantasy literature, along with all the many related subjects that interest us as readers.

We regularly publish new original short fiction from voices both new and legendary (and on very special occasions, both at once), as well as daily commentary on science fiction, fantasy, and related subjects from a wide range of writers from all corners of the field. Our aim is to explore, encourage, and enable interesting and rewarding conversations with and between readers.

Reactor was formerly known as Tor.com, a publisher neutral community blog begun by Tor Books on July 20, 2008, and as such, boasts contributors and content from many different publishers and fandoms. Tor.com renamed itself "Reactor" on January 23, 2024, to better reflect its maturity and growth of scope beyond Tor and sci-fi/fantasy literature, although the latter remains its primary focus."
