"Named in homage to the master work of Geoffrey Chaucer, Constellary Tales casts the centuries-old tradition of storytelling across time and space. Our editorial mission is to find and share great speculative fiction stories that are, above all, simply great stories. (Prose can be stylish, but it doesnâ€™t have to be. Characters can be complex, except when a story demands them to be painted with a coarse brush. But a driving narrative is a sine qua non.)"
