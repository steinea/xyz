"The Imaginary Engine Review is a new project from editors Grace Benfell and Phoenix Simms. Monthly, we cover one game or a set of games from a single developer in a series of critical essays. You can read more about our goals and intentions on our about page. In short, we want to build a sustainable website (and newsletter) for criticism for the margins and by the margins."
