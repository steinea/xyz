"Dangerous to Go Alone is a new reader-funded independent games blog that avoids discourse, SEO trends, clickbait, and hot takes. We're an independent team analyzing video games as the reflective, humane pieces of art that they are.

They may be collections of ones and zeros, but games can tell us a lot about being alive. They're fun, absolutely, but they can also be probing, confrontational, emotional experiences. We want to help remind people that criticism is a kindness, an act of love, a journey writers invite readers on to uncover some under-explored aspect of life.

Our name comes from The Legend of Zelda, but it isn't just a sly reference. The outside world is scary lately, and a lot of things are uncertain. Although Link got a sword, we hope that our writing can provide comfort and connection in these dark times. Take our writing, our phrases, our thoughts and ideas and know that you are not alone. Take it all, if you'd like."
