> McGill-Queen's University Press invites submissions for the [Hugh MacLennan Poetry Series](https://www.mqup.ca/browse-books-pages-46.php?filters=a%3A1%3A{i%3A13%3Bs%3A4%3A%222542%22%3B}). Only manuscripts from poets who write in the English language and who are Canadian citizens or permanent residents will be considered. Please send only final completed manuscripts, as revised versions will not be accepted once a manuscript is under consideration. We do not accept chapbooks or very short manuscripts. Submissions are encouraged from poets who have published books with other presses and also from emerging poets who have published a significant number of poems in journals or chapbooks. We ask that poets disclose upon submission whether their manuscript is under consideration elsewhere.
