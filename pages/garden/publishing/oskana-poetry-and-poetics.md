> Publishing new and established authors, Oskana Poetry & Poetics offers both contemporary poetry at its best and probing discussions of poetryâ€™s cultural role. Oskana is the Cree word for "bones," and we use it with the blessing of Elder Noel Starblanket. The name reflects our commitment to speak to the deepest and most urgent issues of our time, including environmental crisis and Indigenous justice.

> The series seeks original manuscripts in English from both new and established Canadian authors. It also welcomes works of literature translated from First Nations and other Indigenous North American languages. The requirement of Canadian citizenship does not apply to the authors or translators of such works.

> Typically, URP publishes two books per year in the Oskana series.
