"The Carnegie Mellon University Press was founded by Gerald Costanzo, a professor in the Creative Writing program, in 1972 as Three Rivers Press. Now publishing for more than 50 years, the CMU Press was among the first to publish works by poets who would become Pulitzer Prize winners, including Rita Dove, Ted Kooser, Franz Wright, Stephen Dunn and Peter Balakian.  In 2024, the Carnegie Mellon University Press brand expanded to include other publishing ventures at the university and continues its strong commitment to publishing literary works."
