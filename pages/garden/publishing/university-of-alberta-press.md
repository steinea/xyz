> University of Alberta Press publishes poetry, creative and trade nonfiction, and short fiction by Canadian citizens and landed immigrants. It is important for us to know if authors are Canadian citizens or landed immigrants because our literary publishing program is supported by grants from federal and provincial funding agencies. We do not publish novels. Please visit our list of subject areas and consider our recent publications to identify how your project fits with our publishing program. Our literary publications are listed under the Creative Writing subject heading, and we strive to connect our scholarly and literary lists by topic and theme.
