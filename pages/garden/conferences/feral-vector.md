"Feral Vector is not like other game design events. If you feel like an impostor at games events, you’re not only welcome here, we encourage you to attend. If you are in the videogames industry, but looking for more than it can give, Feral Vector is for you. Feral Vector is fundamentally about outside influences, accessible tools, and the fringes of game design – because that’s where the interesting stuff begins.

You’ll find Feral Vector in an old church next to a wooded ravine, up above the town of Hebden Bridge. We run workshops, talks, interviews, live games, local multiplayer, Q&As, performances, walks, and other things. It’s centred on the subject of game design, its wider influences, the places people think it should go next, and the neglected, ignored places it’s already been.

Business doesn’t do culture. We do."
