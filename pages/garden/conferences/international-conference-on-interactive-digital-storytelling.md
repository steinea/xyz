"ICIDS stands for the International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling. ICIDS is the premier conference for researchers and practitioners concerned with studying digital, interactive forms of narrative from a variety of perspectives, including theoretical, technological, and applied design lenses. The annual conference is an interdisciplinary gathering that combines technology-focused approaches with humanities-inspired theoretical inquiry, empirical research, and artistic expression."
