"A membership group open to professionals that work in the games industry that consists of regular virtual and in person events, exclusive offers, and networking opportunities.

On the first Friday of every month we run a ZOOM call for 12 hours (to accomodate all the various timezones), where we randomly put people into breakout rooms for 20 minutes at a time to hang out. It's a simple yet surprisingly fun format (more details here), as you can drop in or out whenever you like during the time it runs."
