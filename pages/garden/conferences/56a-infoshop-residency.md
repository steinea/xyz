"This is a call out for artists of all kinds to be a part of a playful & gentle residency based at the archive of the 56A Infoshop in Elephant & Castle, an anarchist social centre that has been open to the public since 1991. Collectively run, the Infoshop offers a generous and open space for encounters around radical ideas and materials.

We are looking for artists interested in bringing these materials to life through their own practice and in collaboration with other residents; who are seeking to experiment, take risks and branch out or push the boundaries of their usual practice, register or style.

One of our jumping off points is the local legend Joanna Southcott, a popular self-enacted prophetess who left behind a ‘box of secrets’ to be opened in a time of crisis. We invite participating artists to think of the archive as a box holding secrets we might use not only to avoid crisis, but to actively (re)enchant the world.

We will start locally, exploring enchantment in Elephant & Castle, and how we might interact with the area as a collaborator and playground. Potential themes we are interested in looking at together are: magic; local myths & lore; the secrets of the city; play & collective effervescence, ritual and enchantments.

As hosts and facilitators, 56A Infoshop and holobiont will contribute ideas, stories, methods and resources, but hope the residency will be shaped by participating artist’s practices and interests. Some things we can offer as starting points are: critical walking practice, eccentric archival research, counter-cartography, auto-ethnography, and queering as a practice. If any of this intrigues you, we implore you to apply!"
