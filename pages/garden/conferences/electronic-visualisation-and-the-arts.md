"Held annually in July, EVA London is one of the international Electronic Visualisation & the Arts conferences. The first EVA conference was held in 1990, with the intention to create a space for people using or interested in the new technologies to share their experiences and network in a friendly, collaborative atmosphere. EVA Londonâ€™s focus is on the development and application of visualisation technologies to various domains, including art, music, dance, theatre and the sciences."
