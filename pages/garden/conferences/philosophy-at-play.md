"This is the 6th international Philosophy at Play Conference. For some time, we have been discussing questions of power and marginalization and of a relative absence in the conferences regarding the philosophical perspectives of the disempowered. This Conference is therefore going to offer a space for dialogue around and across relations of oppression, marginalization and erasure that we hope can get us beyond the dangers of appropriation and exploitation.

The project to date has been marked by a predominance of Euro-American outlooks. We hope this conference can be the beginning of a process to change this. Although there has been some engagement with majority world philosophical perspectives and with critiques of exclusionary practices, notions of both play and of its philosophical remain understanding contained within minority world approaches. We are alert to the risks of appropriation and extraction and e-deem to the need for philosophical and scholarly humility in these discussions. In recognition of this, we also hope to create a safe space for open and constructive dialogue that can help bring about change. As a result, we are open to various formats and ways to engage in these discussions. In that spirit, the proposed questions and session formats below are suggestive, not restrictive."
