"The 1st International Workshop on Low Carbon Computing (LOCO 2024) will bring together researchers and practitioners with a keen interest in low carbon and sustainable computing. The workshop will provide a forum for sharing new ideas, for presenting ongoing work and early results, as well as for bringing forward well-founded criticism.

LOCO 2024 is an initiative of the Scottish Programming Languages Institute (SPLI), supported by the Scottish Informatics and Computer Science Alliance (SICSA), and was inspired by the Programming for the Planet (PROPL) workshop."
