"Worldcon is the annual convention of the World Science Fiction Society (WSFS). It was first held in 1939 and, after a hiatus during WWII, has been held continuously since 1946. The membership of WSFS is every member of the current Worldcon. There is no Board of Directors or Central Committee of WSFS that manages Worldcons or that selects future sites. The sites of future Worldcons are decided by WSFS members via a bidding process that is open to any group that meets a small number of technical requirements."
