"The Doctoral Program in Operations Management (OM) at the Ivey Business School is designed to prepare students for an engaging and enriching career in conducting meaningful scholarly-based research and teaching in leading schools of business administration.

The Doctoral Program in OM at the Ivey Business School has a strong track-record of exceptional first job placements in Top business schools around the world, including Georgia Tech, IE Business School, HEC Montreal, and many others.

The faculty members comprising this group include Dave Barrett, Jury Gualandris, Fraser Johnson, Rob Klassen, Deishin Lee, Larry Menor, Jason Nguyen, and Gal Raz. Their work is published in the top journals in the Operations and Technology Management disciplines, including Journal of Operations Management, Journal of Supply Chain Management, International Journal of Operations and Production Management, Management Science, Production and Operations Management, Manufacturing and Service Operations Management, Operations Research, and Academy of Management Journal.

The OM group has strong, important research collaborations with top universities and researchers around the world, including MIT, Arizona State University (CASN-RA), University College Dublin, Indiana University, Strathclyde University and Erasmus RSM School of Business, among others.

OM deals with the planning, control and improvement/innovation of the operational system that transforms inputs into outputs and enables value realization for and from customers. OM also deals with the emergence and capable functioning of supply chains as complex adaptive systems that span industries and countries. As such, students will be exposed to, and critically examine, both foundational and recent scholarly developments spanning a wide array of tactical and strategic issues underlying how work gets done in the firm and across firms in order to develop their own theoretical and practical insights on relevant OM topics. While improved decision making and action based upon rigorous empirical science is the primary focus and interest of the OP discipline group's faculty, students will also be introduced to relevant analytical/axiomatic modeling approaches and interdisciplinary theorization that may be informative to the scrutiny of the OM topics.

Students take the full spectrum of Doctoral Program and OM special field offerings; on occasion, students may be encouraged to register and complete courses offered by other Ivey discipline groups and UWO faculties that may be salient to their specific program of study and individual scholarly development. For example, those courses related to advanced statistical and econometrical techniques, network analysis and any relevant other. Other aspects of the program are tailored to fit the student’s own research, teaching and professional interests and requirements."
