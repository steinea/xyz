"The PhD in Humanities, based in the Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies in Society and Culture (CISSC), can be undertaken in many areas of interdisciplinary expertise at Concordia. Our students enter the program with an MA or MFA and come from a variety of disciplines across the humanities, social sciences and fine arts. They benefit from a vibrant academic milieu that encourages innovative thinking and cross-disciplinary approaches to today's vital issues. Some examples of topics being looked at by students in the program include digital culture, First People's studies, globalization and women's studies. Concordia’s outstanding research centres and labs include Milieux, the Media History Research Centre, the Centre for Sensory Studies and the Centre for Expanded Poetics, among many others. Students entering with an MFA or another graduate degree can pursue research-creation projects that combine scholarly investigation with creative practice in a variety of media and platforms."
