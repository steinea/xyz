"Game studies as an academic field investigates digital games from a humanities-oriented perspective, utilising critical, historical, and social research methodologies. Prospective projects may explore issues such as narrative, ethics, audiences, and semiotics, and apply theoretical approaches such as literary theory, philosophy, postcolonialism, political economy, or psychology.

Game studies at Abertay benefits from close collaboration with Abertay's leading Games programmes as well as Dundee's status as a UNESCO City of Design. Abertay University is the lead partner for InGAME: Innovation for Games and Media Enterprise, an AHRC-funded R&D centre for Dundee’s games cluster. Postgraduate students at the University will have access to research and development opportunities, as well as contact with professionals working within the games industry. Dundee is one of the UK’s oldest and most successful games hubs, and we have longstanding relationships with local, national and international game studios."
