"Cultural Mediations is the study of cultural forms that mediate our understanding of the world. It’s no wonder, then, that this innovative PhD program attracts those headed for careers in academia, government and the public sector, as well as practicing artists, filmmakers, and curators.

Selecting from four areas of specialization—Literary Studies, Musical Culture, Technology and Culture, and Visual Culture—students have the freedom to blend these and pursue research projects that call for interdisciplinary and cross-cultural perspectives. We provide a collegial and creative environment with access to an accomplished and eclectic academic community; we enable students to pursue projects that might not otherwise find a home.

This unique program, with its unconventional nature and small and welcoming scale, gives students an edge in the academic context while also preparing them for other career paths."
