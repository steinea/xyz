"The SALA Design, Technology and Society (DTS) Ph.D. program will train designers who will become leaders in advanced specialized research within the design disciplines, develop innovations in technological applications, and create inclusive solutions towards understanding the complex social, cultural, economic and political forces that inform and shape the built environment.

The program provides rigorous research training that will result in the rethinking of the design disciplines through a new generation of scholars and professionals. The program will not separate design disciplines, nor isolate concerns of architecture or landscape architecture from ethics, socioeconomics, environmentalism, and engineering. Interdisciplinary research across design, technology, and society will frame every DTS Ph.D. scholar, from the projects they undertake, the supervisors that will guide them, and the research grants that will support them."
