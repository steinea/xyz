"Use digital technologies to explore questions central to the arts and humanities; applying arts and humanities frameworks to digital tools and technologies.

Digital humanities work involves researching, teaching and learning about the humanities in a digital context—whether that’s building and using software, websites and datasets to display information, or digitizing, preserving and using other technology-focused methods like augmented and virtual reality.

Digital Arts is a highly integrated practice combining strong theoretical frameworks with specific acts of making in graphic design, digital photography, digital video and audio editing, web design, 2D and 3D animation, digital writing, and mobile application development.

Combining the two fields in one degree facilitates dialogue between creative and humanistic studies — a conversation that is central to the Faculty of Creative and Critical Studies."
