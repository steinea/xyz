"Games Development and Technology research considers the development of real-time 3D computer games, games networking and distributed computing. Areas of focus include but not limited to: computer graphics programming, programming of AI for games, exploration of player interaction and gameplay systems, virtual production and interactive visualisation.

Research in this field draws upon supervisory expertise from within the School of Design and Informatics, including academics with track record in mathematics, computer science, games programming, and games industry experience. Applications can encompass not only the games and related industries, for example through development of new tools, techniques, and approaches to game development and technology, but also other fields that can benefit from advanced interactive applications and computer graphics."
