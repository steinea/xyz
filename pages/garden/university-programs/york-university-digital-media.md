"The Graduate Program in Digital Media provides highly qualified students with the opportunity to do specialized hybrid research work in a program that uniquely combines computational science and artistic practices. Work in digital media focuses on a broad range of current and emerging forms of digitally supported media, with applications that range from computer games to interactive art.

The PhD is a four-year advanced degree where the major research requirement at the heart of the program forms a significant and original body of research or research creation with the oversight of a supervisory committee and submission and defence of a dissertation embodying its results. The requirements for the dissertation research are fully aligned with an integrated project that synthesizes theory and methodology from both STEM and creative domains, resulting in a significant contribution to the advancement of knowledge in the field of Digital Media."
