"Gaming and Integration designs, facilitates and analyzes wargames for a wide variety of military commands and government agencies. CNA develops customized designs, tailoring each game type, scenario and move to address the game sponsor’s most complex problems. Our design philosophy emphasizes the learning that comes from creative decision-making, rather than identifying winners and losers. Each game draws upon CNA’s deep expertise in national security operations and strategy."
