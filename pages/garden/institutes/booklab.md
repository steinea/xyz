"Founded in 2018, BookLab actively participates in the College’s Arts for All initiative and the UMD Makerspace Initiative.  BookLab’s resources include six different hand-presses for letterpress printing; a cabinet full of lead and wood type; two typewriters; a 3D printer, Cricut, and Glowforge; material and tools for paper-making, bookbinding, zine-making, and sensors and circuitry for paper computing. We also have an extensive library of artists’ books, experimental books, how-to guides, historical artifacts, books about books, and more. We run workshops, host classes, organize events with visiting scholars and artists, and have regular open hours Monday through Thursday. You can schedule an appointment with us or just drop in–even if you’re just curious. We are always willing to teach, demonstrate, and lend a hand. "
