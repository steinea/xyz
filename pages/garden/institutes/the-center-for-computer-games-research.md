"Games research at IT University started in 1999. Since 2003, the Center for Computer Games Research houses a multi-disciplinary research group with backgrounds in the humanities, social sciences, the arts, and computer science. The group performs basic and applied research, approaching games from a variety of perspectives including theoretical analysis, design, ethnographic and qualitative approaches, AI, machine learning, cognitive and affective user modeling, and player experience.

Members of the group are involved in editorial boards of the most respected journals in the fields of game studies, game culture, game AI and affective modeling and IEEE Task Forces focusing on games."
