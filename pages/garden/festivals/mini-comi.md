"MiniComi is an all-ages, free-to-attend, single day art market held in the Vancouver area.

Every year, we invite over a hundred local artists of all experience levels to promote and sell their artwork and handmade creations. This has included comics and prints, accessories, apparel, toys, and on-site commissions. Artists bring artwork inspired by popular media (such as movies or Japanese animation), as well as completely original work. We welcome all genres and styles!

MiniComi debuted in 2011 at the Student Union Building at the University of British Columbia. Weâ€™ve since then continued to grow, with over 130 artists boothing at our 2018 event!

Costumes/cosplays are always welcome!

The Vancouver Society for the Creation of Independent Art (VSCIA) is a non-profit organization based in Vancouver, BC, Canada. Our aim is to help and promote local artists."
