"XOXO is an experimental festival celebrating independent artists and creators working on the internet. Each year, XOXO brings together writers, designers, filmmakers, musicians, game developers, coders, cartoonists, and more to share their stories and struggles of living and working online.

Our conference talks typically focus on the emotional experience of making things online, with difficult subjects including financial insecurity, anxiety, depression, mental health, impostor syndrome, burnout, racism, sexism, and online harassment.

Our festival events spotlight the best indie artists and projects on the internet across multiple disciplines, including online video, podcasts, music, videogames, tabletop gaming, and internet art."
