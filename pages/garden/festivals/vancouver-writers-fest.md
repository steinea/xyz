"They can delight, inspire, provoke, comfort and uniteâ€”as do the authors, journalists and poets who wield them. At the Vancouver Writers Fest we encourage readers of all ages to explore the power of storytelling, and books, through our dozens of events with local and international writers.

Our activities include both year-round programming and our flagship, annual literary Festival: one of the largest and most prestigious in North America. Tens of thousands of readers visit the cultural hub of Granville Island and venues around Vancouver to connect with local and international authors during this week-long event.

Throughout the year we offer free and paid events with established and emerging authors, in addition to youth education opportunities."
