"Trade Day is a program for educators, professors, librarians, health professionals, developmental therapists, and retailers. It is designed to provide hands-on training, share research, B2B and network opportunities, and participate in professional development opportunities through a day of seminars, demonstrations, and events.

Trade Day is split between several focuses, retailers, educators and librarians, and health professionals. The retailer focus is on business, marketing, and building community. The educators and librarian focus is on how to gamify your classroom/library, gaming strategies in curriculum, and building community. Health professionals, on how games can be used as therapeutic tools.

Anyone with a Trade Day badge can attend all events regardless of the focus; something can always be gleaned from a different perspective. The Trade Day program is open to adults 18 and older.

Trade Day is hosted on the Wednesday prior to Gen Con Indy, held in Indianapolis, IN."
