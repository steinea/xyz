"Year on year, the population of Vancouver and environs grows with more comic creators; each of them with a need to participate in telling comic stories.

As comic art continues to grow as an essential format for local and transnational storytelling, more and more comic creators emerge to participate in the Greater Vancouver Metro Area growing arts scene.

The focus of Rain City Comic Con is four-fold:

* Provide a space where comics creators can present their work and sell their products
* Provide a means for comics creators to network with industry professionals, scholars, fellow artists, and fans
* Provide a forum for comic creators to both formally and informally learn more about comics creation, new technologies, and mentorship opportunities
* Provide an opportunity for comics creators to learn more about the trade industry"
