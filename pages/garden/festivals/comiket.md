"Comic Market (referred to herein as Comiket*1) is a doujinshi (self-published non-commercial publication) exhibition marketplace (referred to herein as doujinshi marketplace) that started in 1975 as a "space" reserved for people to pursue new possibilities in creative expression in the realm of manga and to act as a forum for communication between fans. When Comic Market 1 took place in December 4th, 1975 at the Ninhon Shoubou Kaikan in Toranomon, Tokyo, there were 32 circle (publisher) participants and an estimated 700 general participants attending. In its quest to accommodate the largest number of participants possible, Comiket continually expanded in the following years. When Comic Market 84 took place in August of 2013, there were roughly 35,000 circle participants and roughly 590,000 general participants, there by expanding approximately 1000 times since its inception. Comiket is currently being held twice a year, the summer session in August and the winter session in December, utilizing the facilities of the Tokyo International Exhibition Center (a.k.a. Tokyo Big Site). In addition, a "Comiket Special" is held every five years. New formats that break from the standard mold of doujinshi marketplaces are attempted at Comiket Specials in Comiket's continual effort to challenge what doujinshi marketplaces can do and make them play an even more innovative role."
