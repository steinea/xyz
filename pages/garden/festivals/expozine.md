"EXPOZINE, Montreal’s annual small press fair, is Canada’s largest and one of North America’s largest too! Over the course of one weekend each fall, some 270+ different vendors and creators of all kinds of publications (in both English and French) present and sell their works to some 15 000 visitors. Expozine was born in 2002 with the goal of helping the public discover the multitude of local publications that fall outside the mainstream. It’s also become a place where the small press community and local writers and artists make new connections and plan future collaborations."
