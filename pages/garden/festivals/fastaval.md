"Fastaval is a convention with a proud tradition for creativity. Every year we present, some of the best roleplaying scenarios and board games in the world, exclusively designed for Fastaval. Besides the many different games, you can also experience several other activities. Come and meet our guest(s) of honor, listen in on the podcast hour, participate in workshops and talks, or you can hang out with new and old friends in the Board Game lounge or party in the Fastaval Bar."
