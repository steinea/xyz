"Vampire Survivor developer Poncle has revealed a new publishing division.

Talking at Game Republic's Pitching to Investors and Publishers event in Liverpool yesterday, the team insisted it did not 'want IP' and would not operate as a 'traditional publisher' but would work more as a label or fund to enable people to 'make their games.'

Poncle's publishing arm will offer funding, as well as platform support, localisation, QA, release management, and development advice for games built with 'sincerity, passion, and depth.'

Marketing support will also be available to help indie devs release highly 'replayable, affordable, and fun' games.

'We want to sign everything!' the team said during the presentation. 'But we're very smol!'

Poncle also outlined its 'insta-nos', which included anything 'Survivor-like,' anything AI or Web3 related, and free-to-play mobile games."
