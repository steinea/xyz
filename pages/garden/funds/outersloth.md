"At Innersloth, we make whatever we want. Whether it was a choose-your-own-path Flash game, murderous spacebeans, or poop week (don’t ask), we explored our silliest, weirdest ideas.

We are incredibly lucky with the success of The Henry Stickmin Collection and Among Us. (Dig2China was uh, there.) Our players, friends, and family made it happen, allowing us to be truly independent. No investors, no publishers, no acquisitions.

Sharing our success and supporting indie games is incredibly important to us. That’s why we created our indie game fund Outersloth!

Basically: We want to fund your game. We don’t want to publish your game. We don’t want your IP. We just want to see fun, original, and clever games get made. And we want to make that as friendly as possible."
