"How good is your wrestling?

Ever felt like a fish out of water during standup in BJJ?

When your coach calls 'start from standing', do you feel unsure of yourself?

Well, you're not the only one.

Fact is, takedowns and throws aren’t typically most Jiu-Jitsu coaches specialty or expertise.

Leading them to either ignoring stand up grappling completely, or teaching less than optimal technique.

Sure, you might be a wizard on the ground – but that doesn't mean much if you can't get the match there, right?

Yeah, you've got your guard pulls... But what about the real stand-up game?

Without solid takedowns & throws, you're giving away half your game. It's like going into a boxing match with just one glove.

So here's the deal: getting to the ground on your own terms is half the battle. Standup isn’t just an 'extra' – it's essential."
