"Use Craig’s approach to control to redefine traditional scoring and go beyond points to real control of someone - using this B-Team standard operating procedure

* Combine upper and lower body controls like the claw, the turk, the half nelson, and more into one grappling-specific riding system that keeps your opponents down
* Shut down the turtle with the help of Craig’s advice on using spiral rides, underclaws, kosoto hooks, and more for one unified loop
* Craig is one of the most popular instructors in the world, with ADCC Medals & sustained elite competition success
* Finish fights with systematic submission attempts from your pinning positions, including arm triangles, rear ezekiels, darces, and more"
