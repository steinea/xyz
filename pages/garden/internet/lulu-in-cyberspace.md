"this button wall contains personal websites, created by individuals. pure passion and a desire to share, without profit motives or middlemen who want to harvest your data. the sites here are either recently made or currently maintained. you'll find a wide range of aesthetics, personalities and interests. this is a very small sampling of who you can find on the small web, and i encourage you to explore some of these sites, and when you're done (after leaving a note in their guestbook if they have one ;p), see if they have a links page.. and keep surfing! (websurfing = following hyperlinks, instead of scrolling feeds)"
