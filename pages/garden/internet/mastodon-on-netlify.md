"I recently came across a blog post from Maarten Balliauw that explained how they had managed to create an ActivityPub compatible identity for themselves, without hosting Mastodon or any other ActivityPub server ... I wanted to also set up something like this, but without the limitation Maarten had run into. Since my website runs on Netlify, I decided to try out using an Edge Function to build this up."
