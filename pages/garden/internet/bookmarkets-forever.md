"bookmarklets are weeds growing through the cracks of capitalist software’s walled gardens

bookmarklets are passed from person to person - like a schoolyard calculator game, or a photocopied zine

bookmarklets are yours to keep - to read, write, and tinker with

bookmarklets can’t be broken by automatic updates or server shutdowns

bookmarklets run as comfortably on netscape navigator 4.0 as on the newest smartphone browser

bookmarklets are scribbles on the drab concrete of the corporate web

bookmarklets are a glimpse of a world where programming is for people

bookmarklets forever!"
