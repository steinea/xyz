"Archivematica is an integrated suite of open-source software tools that allows users to process digital objects from ingest to access in compliance with the ISO-OAIS functional model. Users monitor and control ingest and preservation micro-services via a web-based dashboard. Archivematica uses METS, PREMIS, Dublin Core, the Library of Congress BagIt specification and other recognized standards to generate trustworthy, authentic, reliable and system-independent Archival Information Packages (AIPs) for storage in your preferred repository.

All Archivematica code is released under a GNU Affero General Public License (A-GPL 3.0) â€“ giving you the freedom to study, modify, improve, and distribute it. We believe that an important part of preservation is transparency, and that memory institutions should be able to demonstrate at every stage what happens when they process cultural heritage materials for preservation. Archivematica code is always freely available, and our documentation is also released under a Creative Commons Share-alike license.

Archivematica provides several decision points that give the user control over choices about format identification tools, printing the original order of the directories ingested, examining contents for private and personal information, extracting contents of packages and forensic images, transcribing content, and more. Users may also preconfigure most of these options for seamless ingest to archival storage and access. Archivematica offers many ingest workflows: metadata and submission documentation import, zipped and unzipped Bag ingest, digital forensic image processing, SIP arrangement, manual normalization, and dataset management.

In the Format Policy Registry (FPR), Archivematica implements its default format policies based on an analysis of the significant characteristics of file formats. The FPR also offers an editable, flexible framework for format identification, package extraction, transcription and normalization for preservation and access. Your institution can update tools, rules and commands in your local FPR from the Artefactual-managed FPR server. You can also add your own, local policies to your internal FPR. The FPR is integrated with PRONOM.

You can easily search your backlog and your archival storage from within your Archivematica web-based dashboard. This means you can download stored AIPs as complete packages, individual objects, or every package in an AIC. You can also manage your storage and processing locations using the Archivematica Storage Service, including a two-step deletion process that requires justification and approval to eliminate a stored AIP."
