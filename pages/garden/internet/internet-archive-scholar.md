"Content in this search index comes in one of three forms:

* public web content as preserved in The Wayback Machine and Archive-It partner collections
* digitized print materials from paper and microform collections
* general materials from archive.org collections, including collaborations with partners

This [2019 FORCE11 conference presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PARqfbYIdXQ) gives an overview of the technical infrastructure and goals of the project overall.

Metadata comes from fatcat, a public bibliographic database of scholarly work."
