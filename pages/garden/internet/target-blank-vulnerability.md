"People using <code>target='_blank'</code> links usually have no idea about this curious fact:

The linked page gains partial access to the linking page via the window.opener object.

...

How to fix

Add this to your outgoing links.

<code>rel="noopener"</code>

Update: FF does not support "noopener" so add this.

<code>rel="noopener noreferrer"</code>"
