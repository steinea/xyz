"This is a guide to the Chapbook story format for Twine 2.1 Story formats control how a story created with the Twine editor plays in a Web browser; once you select the Play button in Twine or publish your story to a file, whatever story format you have selected takes over.

Chapbook is designed to be easy to work with as an author and generate output that is a pleasure to read by players. It provides sensible default behaviors for your story that can be customized to fit your particular needs."
