"The gold standard until recently has been the 3-2-1 ruleâ€”three copies of your data on two different media with one copy stored off-site."

...

"While not as catchy as 3-2-1, strategies like 3-2-1-1-0 and 4-3-2 offer more protection in the era of cloud backups and ransomware."

...

"What Is 3-2-1-1-0? A 3-2-1-1-0 strategy stipulates that you:

* Maintain at least three copies of business data.
* Store data on at least two different types of storage media.
* Keep one copy of the backups in an off-site location.
* Keep one copy of the media offline or air gapped.
* Ensure all recoverability solutions have zero errors."

...

"If your data is being managed by a disaster recovery expert like Continuity Centers, for example, your backups may be subscribing to the 4-3-2 rule:

* Four copies of your data.
* Data in three locations (on-prem with you, on-prem with an MSP like Continuity Centers, and stored with a cloud provider).
* Two locations for your data are off-site."
