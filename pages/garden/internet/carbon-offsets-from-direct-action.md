"Carbon offsets are actions intended to compensate for carbon emissions to the atmosphere. Calculating offsets involves the quantification of carbon emissions, carbon storage, and carbon removal.

Carbon offset projects can be divided into two categories: avoided emissions and carbon removal. Avoided emission projects are achieved from a wide range of initiatives that reduce or eliminate emissions, for example switching an energy supply to solar power from coal, or reducing high methane-emitting animal populations like camels or cattle. Carbon removals, on the other hand, are projects that expand processes that draw carbon out of the atmosphere such as ecosystem restoration.

This methodology aims to quantify the carbon benefits of industrial sabotage and other direct actions in order to award them the carbon credits they are due, in the same way that other positive climate actions are rewarded. This is the goal of the Industrial Sabotage Methodology, which adopts existing approaches for calculating offsets from temporary carbon storage."
