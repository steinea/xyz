"Lichen-Markdown is a piece of software-fanfiction (aka a fork) of Lichen CMS, originally created by Sensor Station.

The original Lichen inspired us as a light-weight low-power CMS â€” composed of just a few PHP files, it could easily run on small devices, and with little overhead. Self-described as "the simplest possible CMS for the web that is friendly enough for non-technical users".

Lichen-Markdown is a fork of Lichen that works with Markdown instead of Gemtext (the markup language of the original Lichen).

Markdown allows for more flexibility than Gemtext, and we also added some additional features, such as the configuration of a header and footer.

You can read the setup guide, join the Lichen-Markdown matrix room, look at some websites made with Lichen-Markdown, or check out a list of alternatives to Lichen-Markdown that we also recommend."
