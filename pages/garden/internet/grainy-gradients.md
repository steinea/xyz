"In this article, we’ll generate colorful noise to add texture to a gradient with only a small amount of CSS and SVG. Alright, let’s make some noise!

The core technique in this article is built on top of a Stack Overflow answer by Chris [*sic* it's Clint] Pachl to the question: [Can you add noise to a CSS gradient?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4011113/can-you-add-noise-to-a-css3-gradient)

The trick is to use an SVG filter to create the noise, then apply that noise as a background. Layer it underneath a gradient, boost the brightness and contrast, and that’s it — you have gradient that gradually dithers away."
