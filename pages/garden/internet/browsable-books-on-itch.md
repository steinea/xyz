"The entire Songbirds ttrpg is now viewable, explorable, and readable *on* the itch page. I think that’s cool, and it’s something I’m excited to do and will continue to do for different projects. HTML is kinda cool, who woulda thunk?

...

1. You need to use [this EZM reader](https://jeremyoduber.itch.io/js-zine). The itch page has a great tutorial on it. So just go there and download it and read the zine.
2. And then you’ll also need [this EZM hack tutorial](https://solflo.itch.io/ezmr-hack). This shows you how to add custom page counts. For your smaller zines/books, what’s available in EZM when you download it will be all you need. But for bigger books you’ll have to do some HTML editing using notepad (it’s really easy and not scary at all, I promise).
3. Export your PDF as PNGs, rename them according to the EZM tutorial, edit the HTML according to the EZM hack tutorial, zip it all into a file, upload it to itch, and viola.
4. That’s it.*

*you can also fiddle with background colors and things like that for the EZM reader, but all of that is covered in the first tutorial <3*"
