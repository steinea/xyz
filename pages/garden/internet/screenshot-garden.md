"**what is a screenshot garden?**

i've been keeping a screenshot garden for about a year- a handmade place on the internet for my screenshots to live. it is somewhere between a diary, a work-in-progress blog, and my notes app!

you can visit my screenshot garden at screenshot-garden.neocities.org.

i use it to reference old material, store interesting images, and keep a little log in time about what i have been doing, reading, and thinking about.

**how does it work?**

i let screenshots collect on my desktop, then move some of them manually into my screenshot garden, which is a directory on my hard drive. inside this directory are a series of folders that i can sort my screenshots into (or i can always make a new folder). once a month or so, i run a few processes in the terminal that generate a json (data) file which lists all of these folders and images. inside this folder is an index.html file that uses the json file as input. after i run those processes, i upload any changes to neocities, and it is online."
