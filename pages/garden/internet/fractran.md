"Fractran is a computer architecture based entirely on the multiplication of fractions.

A prime is a number that can only be divided by itself one, since these numbers can't be divided, they can considered the DNA of other numbers. The factoring of a number into prime numbers, for example: 18 = 2 Ã— 32, exposes values which Fractran utilizes as registers."
