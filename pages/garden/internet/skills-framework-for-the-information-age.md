"SFIA was formally launched in 2000. Its origin can be traced back to collaborative skills initiatives from the 1980s. The SFIA Foundation was formed as an international not-for-profit foundation that brings together the global community to develop and maintain the SFIA Framework for the benefit of all.

SFIA has become the globally accepted common language for the skills and competencies for the digital world. Within its scope are many of the world's most in-demand occupations, encompassing professionals working in areas such as (but not limited to):

* information and communications technology
* business change
* digital transformation
* data science and analytics
* software engineering
* information and cyber security
* learning and education
* applied computing and computational science
* user centred design
* digital product development, sales and marketing
* human resource and workforce management"
