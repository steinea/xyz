"The *Manifesto on 'Algorithmic Sabotage'* is structured around ten propositions, numbered from 0 to 9, each delineating the underlying principles, strategic approaches, and aesthetic manifestations that constitute the critical concept of 'algorithmic sabotage' within the continuously shifting and intricately intersecting contexts of digital culture and information technology. The document seeks not only to advance a robust, methodologically coherent framework—serving as a structural foundation for militant and tactically assertive resistance, agency, and refusal, in conjunction with strategically prefigurative and critically interventionist technopolitical orientations—but also to disseminate radical theoretical perspectives and criticism, emanating from the transformative impetus of insurrectionary desire. The 'Manifesto' embodies the uncompromising trajectory of a political theory that persistently and ambidirectionally turns discourse into praxis, firmly asserting its presence within the tumultuous dynamics of contemporary liberation struggles."
