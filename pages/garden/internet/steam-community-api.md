"The Steam community API is a web service that provides public access to information about Steam users, their games, achievements, and other related information. In this blog posting I'll describe some of the interesting data you can access, as well as how to model, retrieve, and process that data. I'll also show you how to generate a few fun, simple rankings and statistics for a group of steam gamers.

This is primarily a technical article, but it concludes with the results of a simple analysis performed over a small number of friends and acquaintances on Steam, which may be of interest to the non-technically inclined."
