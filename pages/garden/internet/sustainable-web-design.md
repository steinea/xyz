"Web technology has the potential to bring huge benefits to society and the environment, but only if we use it wiselyâ€¦

The problem: The internet currently produces approximately 3.7% of global carbon emissions, which are rising in line with our hunger to consume more data. Increasingly, web technologies are also being used to sow discontent, erode privacy, prompt unethical decisions, and, in some countries, undermine personal freedoms and the well-being of society.

How do we do it? Sustainable web design is an approach to designing web services that puts people and planet first. It delivers digital products, services, and data that respect the principles of the Sustainable Web Manifesto: clean, efficient, open, honest, regenerative, and resilient."

[Guidelines](https://sustainablewebdesign.org/guidelines/): "Now in their ninth draft, the Web Sustainability Guidelines consist of 94 recommendations to help teams create more sustainable digital products and services. These guidelines were created by the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Sustainable Web Design community group."

[W3C Sustainable Web](https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/sustainableweb/): "The mission of the Sustainable Web Interest Group is to improve digital sustainability so that the Web works better for all people and the planet."
