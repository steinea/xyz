"This pamphlet is the first of many to come in a series we call 'Other Networks For Everyone.' While there are many possible iterations of other networks that are relatively easy to build, we have become increasingly convinced that we haven't yet begun to tap the potential of amateur radio. Since its inception in the early 20th century, nearly all of the discourse in and around amateur radio has been dominated by a forbidding aura of expertise that seems intent on making radio as mysterious and as inaccessible as possible. One could easily say that a radio priesthood laid the groundwork for what Byte magazine called in 1976 the 'software priesthood'---a movement in computing that encouraged users to stop opening up their machines to understand how they work and instead treat them as if they're simple, household appliances that one need not understand."
