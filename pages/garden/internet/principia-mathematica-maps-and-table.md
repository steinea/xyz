"Welcome to the Principia Mathematica Maps and Table Site (PM-MATS). The goal of this project is to make clear structural connections between different parts of Principia and to make analyzable data about the theorems, definitions, and primitive postulates in its text. We do this by providing three digital tools:

1. A map of Principia that allows you to see the whole book.
2. 9,944 mini-maps (one for every starred number in Principia) that show you everything used to prove it and everything that it is used to prove (‚ùã13.1 for example).
3. A table of Principia that allows users to search for specific starred numbers, sections, chapters, and more, and also allows exportation of search results to JSON or CSV files.

This project is supported by a Scholarly Editions and Translations grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities running from 2023 to 2025. This project is also part of the broader initiative, the Principia Rewrite project."
