"An affordable, portable and focused device for music, writing and coding.

Tulip is an all in one portable computer running the Python programming language, with a touchscreen and music synthesizer.

Tulip's processor is a low-power real time microcontroller. It boots right into a Python prompt, thanks to the MicroPython project. We provide a code editor and we ship music programs and other examples. It only does what you ask it to. It has no web browser or social media, other than our fun Tulip-only BBS Tulip WORLD for sharing files. Its constraints and single focus should help you make amazing creative work.

Tulip ships with the AMY synthesizer, a fully featured additive, subtractive and FM synth (think DX-7 and Juno-6) and you can control every parameter of every oscillator in code. Our graphics API is fully programmable as well, with hardware sprites and scrolling backgrounds. Write your own games or synth UIs in LVGL on the Tulip touchscreen and control your creations over MIDI, I2C, or even Wi-Fi.

You're paying the cost of the parts and manufacturing for your US$59 Tulip, with a tiny fee added on to support future development. Tulip is completely open source, from the hardware to the OS to the synthesizer DSP code. It's made possible by excited volunteers and we'd love your help! Tulip is just as fun to work on as to make things on."
