"Solidarity Infrastructures is a translocal learning sandbox that brings together creative practitioners to investigate, strategize, upskill, and dream toward alternative socio-technological systems.

How do we cultivate infrastructures of solidarity with each other, especially under conditions of crisis, protest, and systemic inequity?

Beyond corporate data clouds and monopolistic service providers, the Solidarity Infrastructures ecosystem seeks to reframe technology from a grassroots perspective and in broader context of day-to-day societal and ecological concerns.

We consist of past class teachers and participants from the School for Poetic Computation, as well as adjacent explorers from institutional and community organizations. Our website archives theory, references, and creative experimentation."
