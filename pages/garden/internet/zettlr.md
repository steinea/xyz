"Your one-stop publication workbench

From idea to publication in one app: Zettlr accompanies you while writing your blog post, newspaper article, term paper, thesis, or entire book.

Zettlr is Privacy First: There is no forced cloud-synchronization and all files stay on your computer.

Manage all your writing projects from one app: From the initial idea to a final publication, already typeset in the appropriate template.

Hook Zettlr into your reference manager to have all your sources when you need them.

Writing today is complex and involves many decisions. "How do I organize my notes?"; "Where should I put my to-do list items?"; "What app should I use to put it all together?"

Zettlr brings simplicity back to your writing.

Open-minded writing that adapts to your style. Fast information retrieval that finds what matters to you. Versatile exporting that enables you to adapt to whatever publication pipeline your employer or school uses.

Focus on what matters to you.

Publish, not perish."
