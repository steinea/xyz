"The group exhibition Alt Nets at panke.gallery brings together artistic positions that explore the intersection of community networks, low tech and permacomputing. The relation between these concepts lies in their shared values of community empowerment, sustainability, and accessibility. They represent different aspects of grassroots efforts to reclaim control over technology and communication infrastructure, while also promoting environmental stewardship and social justice/equality. Central to the exhibition is the recognition of the qualities derived from grounding artistic practices in existing contexts, conditions, and communities. Unlike the solutions proposed by technocratic elites, which often overlook collective efforts and community organization, the artists featured in Alt Nets prioritize nurturing and strengthening the communities they grew from."
