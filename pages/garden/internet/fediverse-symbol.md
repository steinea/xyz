"We propose the symbol ⁂ to represent the fediverse.

⁂ is a typographical character, not an icon that needs to be inserted as an image. Unique-looking, but standardised. This means it’s very easy to copy-paste around! Its design style also automatically adapts to the font used where you insert it.

⁂ is called an asterism. In astronomy, it refers to groups of stars in the sky, akin to constellations. We suggest that it’s a very fitting symbol for the fediverse, a galaxy of interconnected spaces which is decentralised and has an astronomically-themed name. It represents several stars coming together, connecting but each their own, without a centre."
