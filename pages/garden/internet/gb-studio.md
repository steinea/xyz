From [GB Studio](https://www.gbstudio.dev/about):

> Hi, my name is Chris Maltby.

> GB Studio began as number of disconnected scripts and tools which were eventually used to create Untitled GB Game, a game built in one week for Bored Pixels 3, a pixel art game jam where the theme was "Game Boy".

> After completing the jam I realised that with a bit of work I could get the tools into a state where they could usable by other people, maybe even by people who had never made a game before. This application is the result of that effort, hopefully you find it intuitive and fun to use.

> I can't wait to see what you make!
