From Wikipedia:

"Picrew is a Japanese layered paper doll-style avatar maker website. It was initially developed by two staff of the Japanese company TetraChroma in July 2017, and officially released in December 2018. The website's concept and interface have some similarities to earlier avatar editing systems, including Nintendo's Mii avatars and WeeMee, and the longer history of digital paper doll games such as Kisekae Set System."
