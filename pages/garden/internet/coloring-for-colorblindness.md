"This website is for people with normal or nearly normal color vision. The purpose of this website is to simulate for you what your chosen color palette looks like to viewers who are colorblind. The colors in the leftmost column are the "true" colors; these are displayed in the remaining three columns the way that a person with protanopia, deuteranopia, or tritanopia would see them, respectively."
