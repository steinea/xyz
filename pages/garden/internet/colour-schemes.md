"Graphics with scientific data become clearer when the colours are chosen carefully. It is convenient to have good default schemes ready for each type of data, with colours that are:

* distinct for all people, including colour-blind readers;
* distinct from black and white;
* distinct on screen and paper;
* matching well together.

This site shows such schemes, developed with the help of mathematical descriptions of colour differences and the two main types of colour-blind vision."
