"The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is a standards organization for the Internet and is responsible for the technical standards that make up the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP). It has no formal membership roster or requirements and all its participants are volunteers. Their work is usually funded by employers or other sponsors.

The IETF was initially supported by the federal government of the United States but since 1993 has operated under the auspices of the [Internet Society](/internet-society/), a non-profit organization with local chapters around the world."
