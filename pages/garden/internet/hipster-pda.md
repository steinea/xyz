"The Hipster PDA is typically notesheets in a binder clip.

Stacking four zines in a binder clip gives a quick DIY notebook with refillable pages. It's a useful everyday carry for folks who don't have a smartphone.

I cut a Bic ballpoint pen to match the height of the zine(11cm) and carry it everywhere with me. I use it to write various workout routines, grocery lists, random things people mention for me to watch or read."
