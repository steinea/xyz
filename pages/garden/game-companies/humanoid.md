"Humanoid Origin is a Canadian game development studio built on the axiom that creative freedom and independence lead to better, more innovative games. Founded by Casey Hudson and a team of game industry veterans in 2021, our first project is a multi-platform AAA title focused on character-driven narrative in an all-new science fiction universe."
