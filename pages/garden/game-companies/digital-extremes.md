"Founded by James Schmalz in 1993, Digital Extremes leapt from early shareware hit Epic Pinball to the innovative Unreal Series (co-created with Epic Games) to the massive free-to-play success of Warframe. Leading with community-first development, Digital Extremes has stayed at the forefront of the video game industry for more than 25 years."
