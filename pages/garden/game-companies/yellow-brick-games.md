"Yellow Brick Games came from the vision of industry veterans wanting to make the process of game creation as fun and meaningful as the final result. Driven by a human and ethical approach to game development and inspired by our warrior princess Dorothée, the idea was to make each moment down the road count, brick by brick. Growing over 30 employees in its first year, Yellow Brick Games is now a collection of over 60 shiny bricks, all working on the studio’s debut title."
