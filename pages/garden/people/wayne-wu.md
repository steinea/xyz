"I am a philosopher who works on mind, action and in cognitive science. Earlier, I was a molecular biologist and biochemist. I treat my philosophical research as part of biology, broadly construed. I currently teach at Carnegie Mellon University in the Department of Philosophy and in the Neuroscience Institute."

Wrote *Movements of Mind* (2024) and *Attention* (2014).
