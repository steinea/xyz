"Walter Andrew Shewhart was an American physicist, engineer and statistician. He is sometimes also known as the grandfather of statistical quality control and also related to the [Shewhart cycle](/plan-do-check-act/){: .internal-link}.

[W. Edwards Deming](/w-edwards-deming/){: .internal-link} said of him:

'As a statistician, he was, like so many of the rest of us, self-taught, on a good background of physics and mathematics.'"
