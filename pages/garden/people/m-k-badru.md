"For about 10 years now I've been making games without funding, using cooperative working models that share ownership and royalties fairly with my coworkers. Some of the larger things I've worked on in the past and am proud of: [Eidolon](http://icewatergames.com/eidolon), [Viridi](http://icewatergames.com/viridi), and [Tenderfoot Tactics](https://tenderfoottactics.com/)."
