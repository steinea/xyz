"Jacques Élie Faure (4 April 1873 in Sainte-Foy-la-Grande, France – 29 October 1937 in Paris) was a French medical doctor, art historian and essayist.

He is the author of the *History of Art*, considered a historiographical pillar in the discipline."

…

"He was passionate about Paul Cézanne and Diego Vélasquez, to whom he devoted his first book. Between 1905 and 1909, he delivered a series of lectures on the history of art at La Fraternelle university in the 3rd arrondissement of Paris. He drew from the lectures the content of his main work, *History of Art*, first published in 1909. This monumental work, which he reworked several times, held a lyrical style and retraced the evolution of architecture, sculpture, painting and domestic arts from prehistory to the beginning of the 20th century. However, it obscured the academic art of the second half of the 19th century."
