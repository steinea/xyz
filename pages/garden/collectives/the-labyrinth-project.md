"The Labyrinth Project is a collaborative inquiry into nature in Los Angeles. Wetlands, lawns, rats, cats, coyotes, mountain lions interact with human affect, state power, indigenous politics, aesthetic pleasure, local governmental power and much more. Also, Satan. Using a mix of participant-observation, structured interviewing, collaborative urban anthropology, historical and archival digging, ecological observation, and analysis of social media content, we explore the diverse and surprising ways in which Los Angeles is full of different naturesâ€” a veritable trophic cascade of the absurd and surprising. We write [research papers](https://labyrinth.garden/research) and we have produced a podcast project in collaboration with the [Laboratory for Environmental Narrative Strategies](https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/lens/) at UCLA."
