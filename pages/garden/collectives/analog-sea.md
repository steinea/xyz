"Analog Sea is rife with stray thoughts, song lyrics, poetry and critical perspective. The last page is a single communication card to order the bulletin for yourself, your lover or your favorite book store (and what’s the difference between the two, really?). They have a bare bones online presence, only a quiet landing page with information on how to contact them. It felt (and still feels) wrong to look them up on Instagram, as though I’m defying a dogma they so wish to uphold. So, instead, I wrote a letter to them."
