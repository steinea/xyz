"We want to be true to the LEGO Group’s original idea of a universal building system and encourage more people to enjoy free building beyond childhood. We believe that the joy of building can be amplified through interacting with likeminded LEGO fans like yourself who appreciate imagination and creativity with offset in the LEGO bricks.​ To further empower your creativity, we seek to resolve the pain points that prevent you from finding the LEGO bricks you need and expressing whatever idea you might have and want to realize."
