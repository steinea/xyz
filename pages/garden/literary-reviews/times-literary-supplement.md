"The TLS was born in January 1902.  Its first ever front page bashfully stated: “during the Parliamentary session Literary Supplements to ‘The Times’ will appear as often as may be necessary in order to keep abreast with the more important publications of the day”. Fortunately, that question of necessity was not left in the hands of literary journalists (who, we can imagine, might occasionally push for a holiday or two), and the title became a weekly one. A few years later, the TLS split entirely from The Times."
