"At a time when books coverage is shrinking dramatically, the Literary Review of Canada offers writers the real estate they need to thoughtfully respond to the country’s vast intellectual output — everything from policy and politics to history, biography, and fiction. The magazine puts the written word front and centre. In addition to reviews, its original essays and poetry provide readers with informed, engaging, and confident cultural context not found anywhere else."
