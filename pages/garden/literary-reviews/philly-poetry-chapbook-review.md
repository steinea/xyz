"Poet, journalist, critic, and publisher, P. Aiden Hunt, created the *Philly Poetry Chapbook Review (PCR)* in 2023. He founded it as an online literary journal for book reviews, craft essays, author features, and publishing news focused on chapbooks.
PCRâ€˜s mission is to bring attention to more chapbooks, their publishers, and their authors. We use the abbreviation 'PCR' because we hope to expand into other genres in time.

We created the *Philly Poetry Chapbook Review* with the simple goal of bringing attention to good chapbooks, their publishers, and their authors. The chapbook form is vital to the poetic world, in particular, and we want to celebrate and share it."
