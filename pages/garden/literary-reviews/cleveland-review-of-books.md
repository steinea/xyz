> The Cleveland Review of Books, founded in 2018, was launched in order to fill a perceived critical gap in the city and Midwest-at-large.
>
> While not exclusively Midwest-focused, we strive to publish writers of and from the Midwest alongside writers from around the country and world.
>
> Our contention is that through publishing, events, and conversations, we can foster a community of critical thought and aesthetic appreciation locally while harboring a discussion that is worth the attention of a national and global readership.
