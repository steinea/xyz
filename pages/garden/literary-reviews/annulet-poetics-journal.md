"As a biannual literary magazine, Annulet seeks to publish poetry that tracks its material nature, whether in language or in form, and prose whose sentences stretch toward, or must be parsed as or with, poetics. We like to read texts that live in between these states (especially for prose) as well as poems keening closely with their form."
