> For over fifty years, _The Capilano Review_ (_TCR_) has supported and been sustained by a vibrant community of readers, writers, and artists committed to experimentation in writing and art. Since 1972, _TCR_ has published work by more than 1,500 contributors and has been a vital gathering space for creative practitioners and cultural critics in Vancouver, British Columbia, and across Canada. Editorially, we’re committed to articulating the view from here and seeking out new work from the wider world of our national, international, and post-national networks. We believe a space to experiment, play, challenge, upend, and subvert is essential to the creation of art and writing that has the capacity to redefine, reimagine, and subtly remake our world.

> Our issues feature full-colour art sections and artists’ projects, poetry, fiction, essays, interviews, and reviews. In addition to publishing three print and digital issues of the magazine each year, we also host an annual Writer-in-Residence, thematic writing contests, and numerous workshops, readings, and other events. We also offer paid editorial internships.
