"Welcome to Chestnut Review, a literary home for stubborn artists and writers! We believe literary markets should be open to everyone. We pay our artists for their poetry, flash, and longer works of fiction and nonfiction as well as chapbooks. We are also a learning center, offering workshops and author feedback, as well as international retreats. If you currently are or anticipate becoming a regular submitter, our Patreon offers perks that will benefit you."
