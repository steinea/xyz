"The Hong Kong Review of Books is an international book review site launched in 2016. We are a Hong Kong platform for discussion of books with a focus on global politics and critical theory, as well as philosophy, literary fiction and international poetry. We are particularly interested in what we think of as ‘radical’ texts: any text which challenges ideas, assumptions and practices and makes the reader think critically, challenging the ideas of our present moment."
