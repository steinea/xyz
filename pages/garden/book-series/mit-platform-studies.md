"The Platform Studies book series has been established to promote the investigation of underlying computing systems and how they enable, constrain, shape and support the creative work that is done on them. The series investigates the foundations of digital media â€” the computing systems, both hardware and software, that developers and users depend upon for artistic, literary, and gaming development."
