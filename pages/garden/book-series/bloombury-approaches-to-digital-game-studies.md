From [Bloomsbury](https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/series/approaches-to-digital-game-studies/):

> Approaches to Digital Game Studies examines the social significance of digital games, bringing together a range of voices from different disciplines in order to advance ongoing conversations and initiate new areas of inquiry in the field of game studies. While conversant in digital game studies, titles in this innovate series bring approaches, theories, methods and questions from other disciplines to bear on the study of games. Each volume is organized around the examination of a single ludic, thematic, or functional game genre.
