From [Amsterdam University Press](https://www.aup.nl/en/series/games-and-play):

> Games and Play in Contemporary Culture and Society is a new international and interdisciplinary book series dedicated to game and play research.

> Its primary focus is on the aesthetic, cultural and communicative aspects of mediated forms of games and play in our contemporary society. The series provides scholars with a peer-reviewed forum for their theoretical, analytical as well as historical contributions to the ongoing discussions on games and play.

> The series is not limited to digital games; it includes play phenomena, both digital as well as non-digital; and it covers social-scientific, humanities, as well as industry and design approaches.

> The proposed books should help readers understand the ‘ludic’ aspect of games and play−the ‘gameness’ of games and the ‘playfulness’ of play−without reducing games and play to mere applications or illustrations of other ideas or issues.
