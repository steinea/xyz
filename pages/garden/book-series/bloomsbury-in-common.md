"The architects of our lives are divided. There are those who insist that there is no alternative to neoliberalism. Despite the many crises it has provoked, they continue to push for competition in every sphere of life, to widen the wealth gap, to ignore climate change and to pursue the steady dispossession of our rights and commonwealth. Then there are those advocating change, those who seek to persuade us that capitalism can be saved from itself, that environmental disaster can be averted through technological solutions, that social injustices can be cured with economic growth and that weâ€™ll be safer with more police on our streets. And yet, we know that capitalism is dying, and that its grip on our world and our lives is maintained only through expropriations, dependency and commodified desires. In Common is a collection of works that see an end to capitalism without apocalypse. It provides us with techniques for building another world, and it narrates practices of alternatives and theories of hope. It is a glimpse into our shared present, for a future in common."
