"Radical Pamphlets to Fan the Flames of Discontent. A collaboration between [Pluto Press](http://plutobooks.com/) and [The ReImagining Value Action Lab](http://rival.lakeheadu.ca/), VAGABONDS strives to publish an eclectic mix of long revolutionary essays and experimental works at the intersection of radical action, interventionist art, and critical inquiry.

Radical ~ Rigorous ~ Resonant

Anti-colonial, queer, feminist, and militating for collective action and radical joy (including the joy of reading), VAGABONDS aims to publish some of the best and most important writing for the struggles of tomorrow in short, accessible, and passionate form. They are peer-reviewed using a generative and open model."
