"The Vienna Circle Collection, as a publishing enterprise, is basically a series of anthologies translated into English of the most important work of individual members. Moreover, the series includes certain work by members of the Circle, or those who had a particular influence on it, which are of special scientific or historical importance. Many of the works are translated into English for the first time and, of those which have been previously published, most are out of print. Some material has remained hitherto unpublished, especially the letters which will be presented in this series."
