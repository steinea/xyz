"PhaenEx is an electronic journal affiliated with the Canadian based international [[Society for Existential and Phenomenological Theory and Culture]] / Théorie et culture existentialistes et phénoménologiques (EPTC/TCEP).

Our intent is to provide an interdisciplinary forum for original research in theory or culture from existential or phenomenological perspectives, broadly construed. This includes but is not restricted to philosophical and critical inquiries related to art, literature, science, technology, popular culture, religion, gender and sexuality, applied moral issues and social relations, as well as the history of continental philosophy itself. Submissions in both French and English are encouraged and all submissions are subject to peer review.

PhaenEx is a bi-annual publication: there is a Spring/Summer Open Issue, and a Fall/Winter Special Topics Issue. For each Open Issue the Editorial Executive welcomes submissions from authors both in and outside EPTC/TCEP. Typically, the Special Topics Issue is derived from a recent EPTC/TCEP panel session. Submissions are not limited to panel participants.

PhaenEx is indexed regularly in the Philosopher's Index and is registered with the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ)."
