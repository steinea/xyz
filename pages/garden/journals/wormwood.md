"Wormwood was a regular paperback journal devoted to discussion of authors, books and themes in the fields of the fantastic, supernatural and decadent in literature. It contains essays, articles, short appreciations, new research and perspectives from new and established writers about acknowledged major authors, lesser-studied writers, and those who are unjustly neglected. Wormwood also featured the columns ‘Camera Obscura’, surveying recently published but overlooked books, ‘Late Reviews’, reappraising titles from the past."
