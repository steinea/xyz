"Established in 2006, PARRHESIA: A JOURNAL OF CRITICAL PHILOSOPHY is dedicated to publishing the latest work on continental philosophy, along with new translations and interviews with contemporary thinkers. All pieces published in the ESSAY and REVIEW ESSAY sections of PARRHESIA are double blind peer-reviewed. The Editorial Board of PARRHESIA does not necessarily condone the views held by its authors outside of what is published in its pages."
