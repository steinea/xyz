"Femspec, maintains a voice for communities speculating, theorizing, creating and questioning gender across boundaries.  We include issues of sexual orientation and interdisciplinary approaches, literary/cultural criticism, creative material and teaching-related works.  As a collectively-produced peer review journal, we are inclusive of ethnic and cultural diversity in an internationalist perspective and are committed to publishing experimental feminist prose, poetic works and experiments across media.  Our impetus came from the perceived lack of attention to SF, fantasy, magical realism and supernatural works in feminist journals and audiences; the lack of consistently evolving developed levels of feminisms in SF criticism; and the inadequacy of magical realism publishing outlets in the U.S."
