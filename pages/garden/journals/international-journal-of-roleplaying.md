"The International Journal of Role-playing is a peer-reviewed scholarly journal that examines all facets of role-playing games for an audience of academics, designers, and players. The journal emphasizes analog role-playing games such as tabletop, live action role-playing (larp), and freeform, but is open to submissions analyzing adjacent phenomena and other interdisciplinary topics in relation to role-playing game studies."
