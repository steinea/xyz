"Studies in the Fantastic is an academic journal publishing refereed essays, informed by scholarly criticism and theory, on both fantastic texts and their social function. Although grounded in literary studies, it also publishes articles examining genres and media that have been underrepresented in humanistic scholarship. Its subjects include weird fiction, science fiction, speculative fiction, fantasy, video games, architecture, science writing, futurism, and technocracy."
