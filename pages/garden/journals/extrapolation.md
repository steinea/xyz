"Extrapolation was founded in 1959 by Thomas D. Clareson and was the first journal to publish academic work on science fiction and fantasy. It continues to be a leading, peer-reviewed, international journal in that specialized genre in the literature of popular culture. It welcomes papers on all areas of speculative fiction and culture, including print, film, television, comic books and video games, and particularly encourages papers which consider popular texts within their larger cultural context."
