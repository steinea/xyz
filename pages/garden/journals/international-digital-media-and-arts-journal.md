"The Journal of The International Digital Media and Arts Association was founded in 2003 and responds to the rapidly developing field of digital media and arts in a variety of settingsâ€”academic, educational, artistic, political, and social. The purpose of the journal is to promote awareness of this growing field and to prompt discussion about the issues that are a part of our increasingly digital world."
