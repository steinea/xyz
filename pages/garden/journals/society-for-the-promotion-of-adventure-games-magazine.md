"Issues of SPAG are published on a roughly quarterly basis. Sixty issues of SPAG were published before the shift to this website. Find our older issues at the archives. In the past SPAG had a big focus on reviews, but as there are now many websites hosting reviews (such as the IFDB), we want to focus on articles that analyse and synthesise the ideas of the IF world. If you like the sound of that and would like to write for SPAG, please contact us, weâ€™re always looking for more authors!"
