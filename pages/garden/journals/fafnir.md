"Founded in 2014, Fafnir is a World Fantasy Award-winning, peer-reviewed, interdisciplinary journal published by The Finnish Society for Science Fiction and Fantasy Research. The journal provides an open-access international forum for scholarly exchanges on science fiction, fantasy, and issues current in the field. Fafnir welcomes contributions from a wide range of perspectives, and we publish two issues each year."
