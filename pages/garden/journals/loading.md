"Loading: The Journal of the Canadian Game Studies Association is a forum for publishing original and interdisciplinary academic research on video games. We accept work from a variety of perspectives: from research on video game cultures and industries to educational approaches to the study and development of digital games, and from computer science driven papers on designing and testing games to psychological research on video games and their effects."
