"CD-ROM Journal is your guide to the most interesting, obscure, and strange games and multimedia art throughout history. My goal is to bring you fascinating things youâ€™ve never heard of and to provide deep dives into underexplored art. I have a particular, though not exclusive, focus on Japanese CD-ROM games."
