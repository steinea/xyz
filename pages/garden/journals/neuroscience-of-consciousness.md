"*Neuroscience of Consciousness* is an open access journal which publishes papers on the biological basis of consciousness, welcoming contributions from neuroscience, cognitive science, psychology, philosophy, computer science, and allied disciplines. Submissions can be empirical, methodological, theoretical, or philosophical, and need not directly address the biological basis of consciousness so long as the relevance to this topic is clear. As well as the primary phenomenon of consciousness itself, relevant topics include interactions between conscious and unconscious processes; selfhood; emotion; metacognition and higher-order consciousness; intention, volition, and agency; individual differences in consciousness; altered states of consciousness; disorders of consciousness in psychiatry and neurology; and consciousness in infants, non-human animals, and machines. The journal publishes research articles (including registered reports), review articles, brief communications, and ‘spotlight’ commentaries. See instructions to authors for more information on article types."
