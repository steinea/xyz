"_Storyworlds_ is an interdisciplinary journal of narrative theory. Featuring cutting-edge research on storytelling practices across a variety of media, including face-to-face interaction, literary writing, film and television, virtual environments, historiography, journalism, and graphic narratives, the journal foregrounds research questions that cut across established disciplines--and hence promotes new, integrative frameworks for inquiry. How do narrative ways of worldmaking differ from other representational practices used to construct or reconstruct worlds, in a broad sense? What constraints and affordances do particular storytelling media bring to the process of building narrative worlds? What tools are needed to characterize, in all its richness and complexity, the experience of inhabiting a narrative world in a given medium or across different media?"
