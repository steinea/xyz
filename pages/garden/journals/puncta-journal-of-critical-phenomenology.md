"Puncta is an open-access, peer-reviewed philosophical journal established with the specific intention of redirecting phenomenological intentionality. It is our belief that phenomenology is not a mere descriptive practice, but an enactment of critique, that is, an ongoing process of revealing and interrogating the concrete conditions, institutions, and assumptions that structure lived experience, phenomenological inquiry, and thinking. We invite submissions that engage the critical turn of phenomenology via analyses of socio-political phenomena, reflections on the limits and challenges of phenomenological inquiry, or by attending to the history of philosophy, either through its silences or its canonical figures. Critical phenomenology aims to open up a more focused area of discourse that the works of those such as Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Simone de Beauvoir, Frantz Fanon, Hannah Arendt, and, more recently, Lisa Guenther, Sarah Ahmed, Alia Al-Saji, and Mariana Ortega have opened up through their commitments to an engaged phenomenology. We invite scholars to draw both on classical and contemporary phenomenology in order to join our efforts of broadening the scope and import of phenomenological research."
