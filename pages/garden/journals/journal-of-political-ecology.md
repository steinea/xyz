"JPE was established in 1994, as one of the world's first OA social science journals, at the University of Arizona, where it is still hosted by the UA Libraries. The JPE is a 'gold' Open Access journal, with the work done by volunteer editors and referees from academic institutions. Over the years, the JPE has published several important contributions to the field of political ecology, and spanned several disciplines, while remaining free of charge to readers and authors."
