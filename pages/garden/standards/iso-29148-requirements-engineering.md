"This document:

* specifies the required processes implemented in the engineering activities that result in requirements for systems and software products (including services) throughout the life cycle;
* provides guidelines for applying the requirements and requirements-related processes described in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207;
* specifies the required information items produced through the implementation of the requirements processes;
* specifies the required contents of the required information items;
* provides guidelines for the format of the required and related information items.

This document is applicable to:

* those who use or plan to use ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 on projects dealing with man-made systems, software-intensive systems, software and hardware products, and services related to those systems and products, regardless of the project scope, product(s), methodology, size or complexity;
* anyone performing requirements engineering activities to aid in ensuring that their application of the requirements engineering processes conforms to ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and/or ISO/IEC/IEEE12207;
* those who use or plan to use ISO/IEC/IEEE 15289 on projects dealing with man-made systems, software-intensive systems, software and hardware products and services related to those systems and products, regardless of the project scope, product(s), methodology, size or complexity;
* anyone performing requirements engineering activities to aid in ensuring that the information items developed during the application of requirements engineering processes conforms to ISO/IEC/IEEE 15289."
