"ISO 10007:2017 provides guidance on the use of configuration management within an organization. It is applicable to the support of products and services from concept to disposal."

From [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10007):

"ISO 10007 'Quality management â€” Guidelines for configuration management' is the ISO standard that gives guidance on the use of configuration management within an organization. 'It is applicable to the support of products from concept to disposal.' The standard was originally published in 1995, and was updated in 2003 and 2017. Its guidance is specifically recommended for meeting 'the product identification and traceability requirements' introduced in ISO 9001:2015 and AS9100 Rev D.

ISO 10007 defines a configuration as 'interrelated functional and physical characteristics of a product or service as described in the configuration information.'

It defines a configuration item as 'entity within a configuration that satisfies an end use function.'

It defines a configuration baseline as 'approved configuration information that establishes the characteristics of a product or service at a point in time that serves as reference for activities throughout the life cycle of the product or service.'

It defines configuration status accounting as 'formalized recording and reporting of configuration information, the status of proposed changes and the status of the implementation of approved changes.'"
