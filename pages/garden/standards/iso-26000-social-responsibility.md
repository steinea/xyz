"For businesses and organizations committed to operating in a socially responsible way, there’s ISO 26000.

It provides guidance to those who recognize that respect for society and environment is a critical success factor. As well as being the “right thing” to do, application of ISO 26000 is increasingly viewed as a way of assessing an organization’s commitment to sustainability and its overall performance."
