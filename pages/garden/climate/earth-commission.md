"Life on Earth depends on clean air and water, biodiversity, healthy oceans, and a stable climate. These are the global commons: the shared resources that are essential for a habitable planet. The Earth Commission synthesizes the latest science to define these limits, ensuring that the planet remains stable (safe) and everything living on it can thrive (just). The ‘Safe and Just Earth System Boundaries’ are becoming the foundation for future sustainability targets and practices."
