"Race against time to repair an abandoned train station in hell before your salvation, a haunted locomotive, arrives. A six-table megagame connected by a rail network of cursed steel and nightmares.

It's all gone wrong. You and your fellow Delvers are barely standing. You've seen the red-lit horror of the Heart... and you want out. But to journey back on foot would kill you. Your last ticket out of hell is the Vermissian, the cursed transit system that cuts through reality like a screaming knife. There are six stations, each one a siren's song for the locomotive, but none are prepared for its arrival: flooded, buried, or overrun with signal-box cultists... You can hear the shrieking locomotive now, approaching fast. If you can't prepare your station before the train arrives, it will pass through without stopping, and you'll be abandoned in the dark forever..."
