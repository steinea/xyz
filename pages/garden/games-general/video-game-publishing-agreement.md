"The aim of the 2025 Publishing Agreement Market report, which builds off our 2020 GDC presentation of the same name, is to democratize publishing agreement data. By analyzing data from over 100 publishing agreements we hope to level the playing field between both developers and publishers when negotiating publishing agreements.

For developers, we aim to remove the challenge of reviewing a publishing agreement and trying to decide whether the terms are market standard or outliers.

For publishers, we hope the data serves as a reference point from which to judge whether your terms are competitive with those of your peers.

And, speaking to both developers and publishers, if you don’t like the market standard revealed by the data, we hope the 2025 Publishing Agreement Market Report provides an impetus for change within industry contracting terms."
