"Wrye Mash is a general purpose utility for managing and repairing mods and savegames. Currently it is the only tool that systematically prevents doubling. It combines multiple mod-management capabilities making it one of the most strongly recommended utilities for both modders and players.

This stand alone edition of Wrye Mash is based on the latest Yacoby's source. The "editing the file header" bug is fixed  and retains all the extra functionality like drag and drop which is missing from other versions. It has mlox, TES3cmd and TES3lint support and many new features."
