"Morrowind is a game of great depth, a huge world, incredibly extensible and with a thriving community. Unfortunately it's also full of bugs. This is our attempt at defeating the worst bugs in the game, including save corruption; and also adding a few more features people have dreamt of. It patches the original game engine code, so it is for the original program only, not OpenMW.

All fixes and gameplay changes included are optional, you can independently select which ones you want to use in the installer. Gameplay changes are turned off by default.

Compatible with English, West European, Polish, Russian, Steam editions and the Cenega TES Anthology (Polish and English). Compatible with MGE, MWSE, MWE, and FPS Opt 1.96. Not compatible with OpenMW, the Impulse/Gamefly version of Morrowind (due to DRM), nor FPS Opt 2.0.

If you have the Steam version, MCP will redate your BSAs automatically when the patch is applied. This allows replacer mods to work correctly without the work of redating manually."
