"Unless it was made by just one person, it’s a bad idea to give all the credit for a game’s success or failure to a single individual. Koji Igarashi has produced many of the best games in the Castlevania series, but he’s far from the only reason that era of ‘vanias is so beloved. That said, with Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, he’s proven that even without Konami’s backing, and the entirety of his old production team behind him, he can still head up a great game.

Personally, I love all of Iga’s games in one way or another. Under his watch, a certain knowing absurdity has its way of leaking through the layers of gothic fantasy and heavy-metal horror caked on the public face of the franchise. That, along with his tendency to stuff a game with more unessential-but-eye-opening weapons and power-ups than many games see in a decade, are his two signature moves. With that in mind, let’s do a mini-autopsy on the Igavanias we have so far and see which ones are the best."
