"corru.observer is an online mystery-slash-Adventure Game (of sorts) developed by corru.works. It primarily takes the format of a Visual Novel, but intermittently mixes in other gameplay elements. It details the exploits of a (mostly) Featureless Protagonist (you) and their assistant 'Moth', as they delve into strange biomechanical 'corru' artifacts recovered from a shipwreck, utilizing an experimental 'mindspike' which acts as part of an interface that allows the user to experience archived memories. Normally these finds are duds and nothing ever comes of them, but the protagonist and Moth quickly discover that not everything is as it seems with this particular 'corrucyst'" (from [TV Tropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/CorruDotObserver)).
