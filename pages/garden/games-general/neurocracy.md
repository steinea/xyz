"Neurocracy is a browser-based video game developed by Joannes Truyens, Matei Stanca and Younès Rabii under the label Playthroughline, released in ten weekly episodes from July to September 2021. Players explore Omnipedia, a fictional Wikipedia successor launched in 2049, and uncover information about the assassination of its major investor, Xu Shaoyong, by perusing its articles, hyperlinks and revision histories. It has been described as wiki-based metafiction."
