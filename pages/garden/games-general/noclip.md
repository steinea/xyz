"Noclip is a crowdfunded YouTube channel that films and produces documentaries about video game history and design. Our docs are free to watch, fully captioned, and fully funded by ourselves. Become a Patron to gain access to exclusive videos, podcasts and loads more...

Hey, I'm Danny O'Dwyer and in September of 2016, I quit my job at GameSpot to found Noclip. Since then we've produced dozens of high-quality documentaries about video game development filmed all around the world. Funded by our Patrons, we've been on a mission to create a vault of timeless documentaries to help preserve the story of video games for generations to come. All of these documentaries are available to watch on YouTube for free.  These productions would never have happened without the support of thousands of people around the world. Our mission is to be independent & authentic, so we take absolutely no corporate funding to produce these."
