"I have a really large earring collection; I have perhaps as many earrings as I have TTRPGs, and I mainly buy them from local craft markets, not jewellers. They’re all made from resin or clay, or cut from wood or acrylic, by hand or with homestyle equipment, in peoples’ basements or garages, not outsourced to a factory overseas or to a shop where people print 3d-print their ideas. It’s a craft movement, like zines once were.

Zines in TTRPGs in 2024 has come to mean 'A5, highly produced booklet', but that isn’t what zines have traditionally been. They were like earrings: local craft. I think that we should be embracing local craft in TTRPGs. The easiest way, is to make a dungeon. Let me explain how you can make a zine dungeon in the classic sense of the word: A zungeon."
