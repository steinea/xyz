"Last year No Escape added a page to the site detailing some other games and digital culture-focused websites we thought were interesting and valuable. In the first iteration, we reached out to readers directly with the simple ask: what other sites do you read? This year we’ve expanded the list for you to add to your RSS feeds or do whatever else. You can also still submit sites if you like."
