"XP, leveling, skill points and skill trees. Global passive skill tree + a personal skill tree for vanilla characters. These apply modifiers that can modify your run, from simple stat ups to gameplay-changing alterations.

Passive Skill Trees, General Overview:

* XP and leveling system, each character has their own level progress and skill points.
* Monsters grant XP based on their HP (XP is granted on room clear).
* Global passive skill tree with nodes you can allocate using skill points, which grant modifiers to the next run. Accessed from the character select menu.
* Global level and xp bar that all characters contribute to, which are the source of global skill points.
* Character-specific skill trees with nodes more correlated to their gameplay.
* Respec points which allow you to refund allocated nodes. Clearing a floor has a base 30% chance to award one. Can increase this chance through certain tree nodes.
* Can toggle tree effects on/off before a run."
