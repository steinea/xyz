With The Company Archives, Non-Breaking Space, designer of GMT Games 'Cross Bronx Expressway', digs deeper into the game’s argument through an RPG experience layered on top of the boardgame play. Join Non-Breaking Space as they GM a session of 'The Company Archives' with Cole, Drew and a table of Wehrlegig friends, live during Gen Con 2024. Watch the history come alive in new ways through this epic actual play."
