"The Gongfarmer’s Almanac is produced by volunteers ranging from the first-time contributor to many names you’ll recognize as writers and artists from Goodman Game’s official releases. Volunteers participate in many ways, including project management, forum moderation, writing, artwork, cartography, editing, layout, proofing, and working with printers, shipping companies, and print-on-demand and PDF download distribution venues in order to make the whole project happen."
