"This is a high resolution replacer for the Magic Cards font, used in most of the UI - menus, dialogue and the journal. It should provide improved clarity without changing the font size.

The font is derived from the original version specific to Morrowind, changed to be slightly heavier and blacker, as well as being double resolution. Letter kerning (letter pair separation) is improved for the most noticeable misaligned letters - BQRTVchkmnw. It also improves European translated dialogue by correcting all the misaligned accented characters, and ess-set. Fixes O z kreska and c z kreska in Polish version when used with MCP 2.0."
