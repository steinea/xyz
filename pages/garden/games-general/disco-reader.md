"An unofficial search engine and text visualization tool for Disco Elysium - The Final Cut by u/xyrilyn"

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DiscoElysium/comments/kz66p3/disco_reader_an_unofficial_search_engine_and_text/): "What is Disco Reader? (points to the title) It's an attempt at building a simple search engine and text visualization tool for all the conversations that take place in Disco Elysium. You can find it as a web app here: <https://disco-reader.gitlab.io/disco-reader>. (Sorry mobile users, it's not meant to be used on mobile at all. You can try it on landscape mode, but I don't recommend it. I would recommend using the web app on a computer.)

How does the search work? Simply key in some search terms into the input text fields and hit the 'Search' button. Any results will appear in the list below as a pair of IDs separated by a -. The number before the - is the conversation ID and the number after is the corresponding dialogue ID. For example: 1122-132, where the conversation ID is 1122 and the dialogue ID is 132. You can also search by character. In-game, a character is referred to as 'Actor'. You can sort the search result list by alphabetical order, or by relevance score. How relevant a search result is calculated via the BM25 algorithm and is represented by the numerical values you see beside each search result."
