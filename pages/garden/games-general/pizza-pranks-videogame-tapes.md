"Starting in 2023, I began selling Indiepocalypse on USB sticks stored inside of tape cassette cases which I shorthanded to just calling “tapes”. I am now opening up producing tapes (maybe making a production label?) for any developer who would like me to do the same for them.

There are 3 main (non-exclusive) options:
1. I print-on-demand tapes and sell them online through my website.
2. I print-on-demand tapes and sell them at in-person events I table at.
3. I print and ship you runs of tapes to do whatever you want with."
