Learned about from [*Crossplay*](https://patrickklepek.substack.com/p/this-designer-was-tired-of-kids-game).

"Most are poorly designed, and sacrifice thoughtfulness for rules centered on luck. Surely, there must be a better way? That hope is what fueled Elan Lee, designer and co-founder at Exploding Kittens, the group behind popular card games like the similarly titled Exploding Kittens and You’ve Got Crabs, to launch four new games: Hurry Up Chicken Butt, I Want My Teeth Back, My Parents Might Be Martians, The Best Worst Ice Cream. Importantly, Lee did not design these games on his own. They were made over several years with his own daughter."
