"An impact fund for studios led by underrepresented founders across Canada. We support video game studios with studio development training, catalytic investments, and community in order to build strong, impactful teams of underrepresented makers who are shaping the future of games. Studio support---not just project funding. Weird Ghosts invests in founders who want to build profitable impact-oriented studios with a long-term vision and commitment to equitable worker-centric structures. "
