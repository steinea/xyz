"We are a cooperative studio of game developers, artists, and creative technologists dedicated to exploring community-led flows of individual and collective support.

Building something from the ground up that challenges existing power structures is an iterative process - and we're learning all the time. Here are some common questions we're asked.

As a community, one of our shared values is turning our love of video games into a practice of personal and social reflection, accountability, and growth. This work happens at many levels and in many forms, depending on each member's journey. It shows up in the content of our games, the ways we collaborate, and our resistance to social and economic forces that create harm. What matters most is that we all treat these challenges as fundamental to and inextricable from our lives as creators.

Gamma Space recognizes that many of the barriers independent artists face are made worse by the isolation and competition capitalism encourages. This is true of both systemic oppressions - where people with marginalized identities are excluded or tokenized - and the economic inequities that make financial sustainability feel out of reach. Our cooperative studio challenges these norms by collectivizing resources and redefining value through a holistic, community-minded lens. Our Peer Accelerator and not-for-profit Publishing program help members develop games with end-to-end support from the entire cooperative. After release, equitable SEAL agreements bring resources back into the community and seed future projects. This way, the challenges AND successes of creative labour are shared by all."
