"We're an independent AAA game development studio founded by veterans of some of the industry's most recognizable and acclaimed creative teams. Our shared vision is to craft a new generation of narrative-driven, genre-defining experiences that will span both interactive and linear media. With a roster of award-winning talent and decades of combined experience, That’s No Moon, and our debut project, are backed by an unprecedented partnership and more than $100 million investment from Smilegate—creators of the blockbuster ‘CROSSFIRE’ franchise and record-breaking MMO RPG, 'Lost Ark.'"
