"Giant Squid is a highly collaborative, highly technical team of big picture thinkers who share a passion for game development and life-long learning. We have built an inclusive environment that values experimentation, teamwork, and excellence in craftsmanship. Above all else, we value our team! Our incredible people are the cornerstone of our success. Magic happens when they are happy, healthy, and working on something they care about â€“ and that translates directly into high quality experiences for our players. In our games, we focus on atmosphere, emotional impact, and game feel rather than difficult skill tests or intricate mechanical systems. We aim to make beautiful experiences that resonate with players in a timeless way. We are always looking for like-minded individuals who are excited to help us create the kind of distinctive game experiences that our studio is known for."
