"Established in 1999, Santa Monica Studio became renowned for excellence in the action/adventure genre with the worldwide award-winning success of the 2005 release, God of War, and its subsequent sequels. Our most recent God of War (2018) became one of the fastest selling PlayStation 1st-party games of all-time, and has since won over 190 Game of the Year awards including DICE, BAFTA, The Game Awards, Game Developers Choice Awards, IGN, Game Informer, EW, and Variety. Historically, Santa Monica Studio has also been a pioneer in innovation, mentoring new voices in game development through an 'incubator' program of sorts, and working with acclaimed teams such as thatgamecompany, Giant Sparrow, SuperBot Entertainment, and Tangentlemen. With these teams (and other incredibly talented external development partners), we are proud to have published a number of innovative and award-winning games including flOw, Flower, Journey, Here They Lie, The Order: 1886, Bound, Warhawk, Twisted Metal, Fat Princess, Escape Plan, Sound Shapes, The Unfinished Swan, the PixelJunk series, and more."
