"When talented, creative people work and learn together, fearless in creating something genuinely new, amazing things happen. We are relentlessly experimenting, making plenty of mistakes along the way, and gaining amazing insights everyday. Since 2005, we've seen this process produce amazing results. From Mark of the Ninja to Don't Starve, we've created ground-breaking games across multiple genres. We're always looking for people who love to learn to join us on our journey."
