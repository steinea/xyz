"It seems so simple and obvious, but that’s really what it’s all about. Let’s enjoy our work and appreciate the people we get to work with. And let’s try to advance our industry in the process. Starting something new means we get to change the way things are done - with the games we make, the culture we grow, and processes we use for both. We’re making ‘small-ish,’ creatively-charged, uniquely-stylized games that explore the possibilities of our medium. And we’re building a small, open-hearted team of creators that want to improve their skills and still lead a good life outside of work. People that want to hone their craft, have a say in the process, feel respected for their contributions, and be a part of the evolution of this awesome medium."
