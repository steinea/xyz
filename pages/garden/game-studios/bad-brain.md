"Bad Brain Game Studios is based in Montreal and Toronto. It was founded by industry veterans. Our first game will be an open world, story-driven action-adventure inspired by blockbuster cinema and paranormal thriller novels of the 1980s. We’re bringing it all to life inside of Unreal Engine 5. This deranged cartoon has nothing to do with the game, but studio introductions are usually really boring and it’s our job to entertain you. Hope you like it."
