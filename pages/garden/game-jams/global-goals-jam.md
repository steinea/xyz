"Since 2016 you can organize or join a jam every September to create sustainable impact for the Global Goals! Founded and coordinated by Digital Society School and UNDP, supported by World Design Organization. In 8 years, we have grown a creative community of thousands in about 100 cities all over the world. This year, most of us will be jamming from 20-22 September (during Global Goals Week) and focus on the topic of RECONNECTION AND REPARATION - join us!"
