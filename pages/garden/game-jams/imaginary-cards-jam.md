"Ever wanted to make your own Collectible Card Game?

Yeah, it's a lot of work...

So why not create a SINGLE card from a totally imaginary game?

WHAT WE WANT

Zaniest card ideas! We encourage wackiness!

* A CCG that's not about combat? Amazing!
* Non-traditionally shaped cards? Why not!
* Cards in an alien language? Rad!

We are not looking for masterpiece works of art: Hand-draw something! Use PowerPoint as a design tool! Take open-source images from a national archive!

Our main rule is that it must be understood as a 2-dimensional card (physical or digital). You may submit a front and a back of a card, if you wish. Please make your images viewable directly on your itch page, without necessitating a download. It makes it easier for the judges."
