"This jam invites everyone to produce a Zine (either physical or digital) on research theyâ€™ve done OR a correctly cited/referenced research paper they really love.

Faun and Hollis (us, the co-hosts!) are two people very passionate about research and learning. Once you leave a traditional academic setting, there seems to be a steep drop off in how often you get to nerd out on research, or even get to deep dive into a topic.

So - what do you do about that? You make a zine jam of course

The Goal: To celebrate research you love/has affected you and to make research more accessible."
