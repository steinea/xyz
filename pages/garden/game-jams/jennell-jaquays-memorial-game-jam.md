> This game jam is a memorial for the legendary game designer and Queer activist Jennell Jaquays. Jennell's work was fundamental in shaping early tabletop roleplaying games and how we all assemble maps and dungeons.
>
> She also left a major mark on the video game industry working as Director of Game Design for Coleco, as a level designer for id Software, Ensemble Studios, and CCP Games. She was also one of the co-founders of the video game education program, The Guildhall at SMU.
>
> As a Queer activist, she worked as creative director for the Transgender Human Rights Institute in Seattle was involved in the petition to create "Leelah's Law," outlawing conversion therapy of LGBT youth.
>
> She will be sorely missed as a mentor and role model for countless people.

#### Return to Perinthos

> This game jam seeks entries to include in a published book titled Return to Perinthos as a memorial to Jennell Jaquays. The final book will contain a setting to tying everything together written by the fabulous Luke Gearing!
>
> At the conclusion of this jam, we will hold a Crowdfundr to sell pre-orders for the physical copy of book and to collect donations.
>
> All profit from the Crowdfundr will be donated to Jennell Jaquays's family to help with medical and funeral expenses. Future profits from further sales of the book will be donated to Trans Lifeline.
>
> If you would like to contribute to her family right now, you can use their GoFundMe as well.
