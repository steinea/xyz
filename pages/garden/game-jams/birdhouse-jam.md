"Songbirds is an adventure game I wrote a long time ago and I recently released the 3rd edition of it. It's really dope. I'm proud of it.

As you can see it's got adventure game stuff. Gifts & Curses are the classes. There's a "how we met" table. Body mods for when you lose a limb. Several different kinds of magic. Dungeons. Monsters. All that good stuff.

This jam is for y'all to make some more of that cool stuff. Including adventures! I'll be making one of those along with lifepath character gen rules. It's gonna be dope."
