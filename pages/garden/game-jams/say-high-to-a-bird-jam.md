"Hello hello! I'm Logan Timmins, coming to you from Wurundjeri Country, and I love lyric games.

What I love about lyric games is that they can be very personal, emotional, and intimate. They can provide a snapshot of something harrowing, transformative, or beautiful, and an invitation for others to experience that too.

I was inspired to run this jam after completing season 1 of the Lyrical Ludology podcast. The theme of this jam is owed to the listeners in the discord - thank you everyone!

Ok, so what do I actually do for this jam?

Make a lyric game! You choose what 'lyric game' means to you. Please share your interpretation of 'lyric game' in the discussion tab or the discord if you feel to!

Your game should include one or more of the following:
- birds
- instructions for saying hi to birds
- your favourite bird
- something about building relationships with birds
- is written by or with birds
- flight, migration, nests, feathers, eggs, etc
(and remember, birds can be a metaphor for lots of things ðŸ¦†)

Is there any live interaction stuff happening?

Sure is! If you hop over to the discord, there will be weekly text-based check-ins, the option to join in co-working hours, and the opportunity to find collaborators.

Can I submit a game I already made?

Sure! I'd love to check it out :)

Anything else I should know?

This gam jam is not ranked. It is a spark for imagination and creativity.

Any bigoted content will not be tolerated and will be removed without warning.

If you want to join the Lyrical Ludology discord, it's a great place for chatting about lyric games, finding collaborators, and generally being nerds."
