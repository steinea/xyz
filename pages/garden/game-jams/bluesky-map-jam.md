"Twitter has gone through some undesirable changes in the last couple of years, causing many people to move to Bluesky as an alternative. I began this project with Agent Strange as a way for Doom mappers and modders to find each other on the new social media site and to show off their skills.

This resulted in an incredible project, with mappers from all disciplines, creating excellent maps with all kinds of aesthetics and gameplay styles. There's something for everyone in here (at least I hope so, with 44 maps!). "
