"Board games have been around forever, so it's high time we pay our respects by harvesting them for all the tasty bits worth stealing! Board Games Reimagined! TTRPG Jam invites game designers (whether you were one or not beforehand) to create a tabletop roleplaying game based on or inspired by a board game or board game mechanic. Create a taut political thriller rpg with checkers as its primary conflict resolution or use a cribbage board as a progress clock. Write a sprawling epic quest set in color-coded lands of candy or track resources with a mancala board. Clean out the old board game shelf and see what lights a spark!

This jam theme is inspired by my own game, Spell: The RPG, which uses letter tiles (like from Scrabble or Bananagrams) for its magic system. When you build your game, you can pick and choose mechanics or components from one or more games, or just adapt general board game vibes into a new, narrative format."
