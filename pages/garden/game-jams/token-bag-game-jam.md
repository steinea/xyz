"token bag game jam is a 3-week tabletop roleplaying game jam hosted by amber autumn faebrooke and violet henderson focusing on the creative ludic potential of the token bag. we define a token bag game as “any game that uses drawing objects from a bag or other opaque container as a way of creating randomization.” games from arkham horror: the card game to the quacks of quedlinburg to troika have made a big splash using token bags the last few years, but we believe there is a treasure trove of unexplored design space in the mechanic. that’s where you come in."
