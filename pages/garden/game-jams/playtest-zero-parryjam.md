"This is a game jam to make a game where basically all you do is Parry. Sure, you could also Dodge Roll or Pay Respects, but the main thing you should be doing in the game is Parry. There is beauty and elegance in honing a single mechanic and using it in any and all situations, like the classic beloved combat sport, Divekick."
