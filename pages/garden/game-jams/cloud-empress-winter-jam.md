"The Cloud Empress  Winter Jam explores what the winter season looks like for the Land of Cicadas. As winter sets into our real-world northern hemisphere, all that's needed for inspiration is to look there. How are the travelers faring in these times? In what ways is winter even harsher in the Lowland Wastes? And what opportunities does that bring for those keen enough to seize them?"
