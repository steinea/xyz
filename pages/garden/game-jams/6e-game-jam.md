"This one is for the queer, underprivileged, POC, and black creators that are trying to take and reclaim what that one company from the coast has forged. This one is for you. Take it.

There's no limit to what your 6e should look like. Make it yours to play at the table.

Fuck the rest.

This'll be open for the rest of the month so share it when you can, share your game, promote other peoples' games. Rate everyone and support each other. We can use this as a banner, or a platform, or a god damn weapon.

It's your choice."
