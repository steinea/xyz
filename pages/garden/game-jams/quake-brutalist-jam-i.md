"Over two and a half weeks, creators new and veteran created maps centered around concrete and brutalist architecture. Built in the gameplay mod [Copper](https://www.slipseer.com/index.php?resources/copper.27/) (included), the pack includes 35 levels almost entirely made in the Makkon concrete texture set. It is recommended to play this pack with a modern source port of Quake. This pack has been tested with IronWail, Quakespasm, and vkQuake."
