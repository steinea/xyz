"WHEELJAM is a week-long game jam focused around the persuasion minigame mechanic from The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and later repurposed for Bass Reeves Can't Die.

The jam runs from Thursday, March 13 to Thursday, March 20 -- the 19th anniversary of Oblivion's initial launch in 2006.

The goal is to make a game that in some way incorporates the Oblivion persuasion mechanic.  If the thought of doing so fills you with existential dread, don't fret!  Colin has a bsky thread explaining how the wheel works here, the engine templates you'll find below are ready to be fiddled with, and our Discord server is open for discussion where someone is sure to help you smooth over any remaining confusion."
