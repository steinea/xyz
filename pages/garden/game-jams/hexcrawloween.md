"It's the most wonderful time of the year, so in the spirit of the spooky season let's make some Halloween hexcrawls!

The rules are simple, in the next month create a system-agnostic hexcrawl that has:

* 20 keyed hexes (that's a 4Ã—5 grid)
* At least 1 town/settlement with NPCs
* Dungeons! (pick A or B)
  * A - 5 dungeons (3 6-room, 1 12-room, and 1 24-room)
  * B - As many dungeons as you like of any size, so long as there are 54 rooms total
* A bestiary with 9 original monsters, 3 of which are unique (only one of them exists in the world)
* An encounter list with at least 1d20 entries
* Hand-drawn maps, done on paper then scanned or photographed"
