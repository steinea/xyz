"Over three and a half weeks, mappers created maps loosely centered around the Brutalism architectural movement. From concrete hellscapes to brutal liminal voids, imaginations and creativity ran wild in this jam, and created some truly stunning experiences! Built in the gameplay mod [Copper](https://www.slipseer.com/index.php?resources/copper.27/) (included), the pack includes 30 levels lovingly crafted by mappers both new and veteran, many maps created by first time mappers."
