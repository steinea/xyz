"This is a jam for creating TTRPG settings that can fit within a few pages. Worldbuild on a small scale from January 17th-31st.

**Rules**

Make a TTRPG micro setting supplement/zine/booklet that’s no longer than 8 pages.

* It can be for any TTRPG system you’d like or it can be system agnostic.
* Any images (e.g. illustrations or maps) must be included within the page limit.
* Keep the scope small, easy, and fun to make. Instead of expansive atlases of entire planets, think more along the lines of cities, towns, ruins, gardens, parks, neighborhoods, houses, etc."
