"The Center was created in 1992 to create high performance organizations that enrich human life and achieve extraordinary results.

We believe that 'all organizations are perfectly designed to get the results they get.'  Results are not by chance but rather a function of the way we design our organizations. By design, weâ€™re talking about the integration of people with core business processes, technology, structure and systems. A well-designed organization ensures that the form, or infrastructure of the organization, matches its purpose and strategy, meets the challenges posed by business realities and significantly increases the likelihood that the collective efforts of people will be successful."
