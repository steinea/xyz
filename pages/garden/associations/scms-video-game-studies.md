"The Video Game Studies Scholarly Interest Group (VGSSIG) serves as the official home of game studies and game design for the Society for Cinema and Media Studies (SCMS). Since its establishment in 2008, the VGSSIG has supported a diverse group of scholars and media professionals in critical study and creative engagement with games, gaming histories, and playing practices that approach games as media texts, as technological artifacts, as commercial products, and as sites of cultural negotiation."
