"The Pacific Ancient and Modern Language Association (PAMLA), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit association, was founded as the Philological Association of the Pacific Coast in 1899. PAMLA, the western regional affiliate of the [Modern Language Association (MLA)](https://www.mla.org/), began its association with the MLA in 1918. PAMLA hosts an annual scholarly Humanities conference for approximately 800 to 1,000 members.

The Pacific Ancient and Modern Language Association is dedicated to the creation, advancement, and diffusion of knowledge of ancient and modern languages, literatures, media, cultures, and the arts. In addition to its annual conference, PAMLA publishes two annual issues of [*Pacific Coast Philology*](https://www.pamla.org/pacific-coast-philology/), its peer reviewed scholarly journal, and hosts [PAMLA Arts Matter](https://www.pamla.org/pamla-arts-matter/) and [PAMLevents](https://www.pamla.org/pamlevents/)."
