"TTGDA is a new organization dedicated to supporting Tabletop Game Designers. As the tabletop game industry grows, and the number of designers, both independent and within publishers, skyrockets, the need for support has grown.

Launching in Q1 2024, TTGDA will support designers of all types of tabletop games, including board games, role playing games, card games, miniature games, and others, whether mass market, specialty, or hobby."
