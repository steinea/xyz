"The Warwick Research Collective (WREC) was formed in 2007 by members of the Department of English and Comparative Literary Studies with a shared interest in recent theorisations of world literature. Following an inaugural talk by Benita Parry (“Is There a Third-World Aesthetic?”), WREC has established a research agenda based on the challenge of theorizing a world-literary system that is, in the words of Franco Moretti, ‘simultaneously one, and unequal.’"
