"Over the last years, computer games have received growing attention from academic fields as diverse as psychology, literary studies, sociology and learning studies. The game philosophy initiative aims to broaden the scope of this effort by facilitating discussions dealing with philosophical issues raised by computer games. By doing so, we do not only want to contribute to our understanding of this phenomenon, we also want to contribute to the establishment of a new philosophical discipline, the philosophy of traditional games and computer games, capable of taking its place alongside such disciplines as the philosophy of film and the philosophy of literature."
