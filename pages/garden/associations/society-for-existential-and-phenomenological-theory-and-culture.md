"Founded in 2003, the Society for Existential and Phenomenological Theory and Culture (EPTC) is a Canadian-based international academic society that aims to promote rigorous scholarship drawn from the traditions of existentialism and phenomenology, broadly construed. In addition to theoretical work on core philosophical issues and figures, we are especially interested in providing a forum for showcasing practical and applied research, as well as cross- and interdisciplinary developments of existential and phenomenological themes."
