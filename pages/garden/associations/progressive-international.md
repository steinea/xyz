"The Progressive International launched in May 2020 with a mission to unite, organize and mobilize the worldâ€™s progressive forces.

<br>

#### Our Vision

We aspire to a world that is:

* Democratic, where all people have the power to shape their institutions and their societies.
* Decolonised, where all nations determine their collective destiny free from oppression.
* Just, that redresses inequality in our societies and the legacy of our shared history.
* Egalitarian, that serves the interests of the many, and never the few.
* Liberated, where all identities enjoy equal rights, recognition, and power.
* Solidaristic, where the struggle of each is the struggle of all.
* Sustainable, that respects planetary boundaries and protects frontline communities.
* Ecological, that brings human society into harmony with its habitat.
* Peaceful, where the violence of war is replaced by the diplomacy of peoples.
* Post-capitalist, that rewards all forms of labour while abolishing the cult of work.
* Prosperous, that eradicates poverty and invests in a future of shared abundance.
* Plural, where difference is celebrated as strength.

<br>

#### Activities

Our activities are divided across four pillars:

* Movement
* Blueprint
* Wire
* Observatory

<br>

*Movement*

We are connecting, supporting, and mobilising activists around the world.

Each week, we share toolkits, host training, and convene forums that bring together members of the Progressive International.

Become a member, and participate in the Movement pillar.

<br>

*Blueprint*

We are designing a policy blueprint to transform the institutions that impact our lives, our communities, and the planet.

The Progressive International convenes activists, thinkers, and practitioners to develop the principles and policies of a progressive international order.

Explore the inaugural collection of the Blueprint pillar below.

<br>

*Wire*

We are a wire service to the world's progressive forces.

Every day, the Wire translates stories, essays, and statements from Progressive International members and partner publications.

Our aim is to provide a diversity of perspectives on international issues. Publication in the Wire is not an endorsement from the Progressive International.

<br>

*Observatory*

We are building a global observatory with the legal expertise, data science, and parliamentary power to track the attacks on our democratic institutions and provide a real-time defense against them."
