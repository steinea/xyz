"The Crime Writers’ Association was founded in 1953 by John Creasey. Our overall aim is to support, promote and celebrate this most durable, adaptable and successful of genres. The CWA’s everyday aim is to support writers of every kind of crime fiction and non-fiction and to promote their work. The CWA is a thriving, growing community and a broad church. Its membership encompasses writers of all kinds of ‘crime’ – embracing procedural, psychological, all types of thriller, cosy, noir and even supernatural and fantasy cross-over. Writers of all crime-related non-fiction, including true crime, are welcome too. Writers of crime for children and young adults are also welcome to join as are authors of crime novels on graphic platforms."
