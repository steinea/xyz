"The Center for Immersive Arts (CFIA) is dedicated to collaboratively preserving the history of immersive theater, escape rooms, Alternate Reality Games (ARGs), theme parks, art installations, XR/VR, and more.

Weâ€™re creating educational resources, helping restore old websites, digitizing artifacts and ephemera, and designing online archives and digital museum exhibitions."
