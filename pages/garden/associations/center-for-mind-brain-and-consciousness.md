"The NYU Center for Mind, Brain, and Consciousness is devoted to foundational issues in the mind-brain sciences.  It takes an interdisciplinary approach, including philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, computer science, and other areas.

The directors of the Center are Ned Block and David Chalmers, both of whom are Professors of Philosophy and Neural Science at NYU.

The center hosts postdoctoral fellows and runs regular research workshops.  It also hosts a regular series of debates between leading researchers on foundational topics in the mind-brain sciences."
