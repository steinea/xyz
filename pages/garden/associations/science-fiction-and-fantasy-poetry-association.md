"The Science Fiction & Fantasy Poetry Association was founded as the Science Fiction Poetry Association in 1978 to bring together poets and readers interested in speculative poetry. Members voted to rename the organization in 2017. What is sf/f poetry? Everybody has a unique definition. To be sure, it is poetry (we'll leave that definition to you), but it’s poetry with some element of speculation in the narrow sense—usually science fiction, fantasy, or horror, though some include straight science."
