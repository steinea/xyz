"The goal of the Society for the Advancement of the Science of Digital Games is to promote and advance the science, technology, design, and study of digital games (also known as computer games, or video games). This is accomplished by operating a yearly conference, the Foundations of Digital Games (FDG). SASDG was established in 2008 to act as the organizational home for FDG."
