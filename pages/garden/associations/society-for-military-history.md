"Established in 1933 as the American Military History Foundation, renamed in 1939 the American Military Institute, and renamed again in 1990 the Society for Military History, the Society is devoted to stimulating and advancing the study of military history. Its membership (today more than 3200) has included many of the world's most prominent scholars, soldiers, and citizens interested in military history."
