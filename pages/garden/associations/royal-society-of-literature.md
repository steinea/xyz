"The Royal Society of Literature (RSL) celebrates and supports writing of all kinds. We are a charity for writers and readers throughout their literary lives. Weâ€™re led by writers and we believe that all literature matters. We work with schools and prisons because everyone should have access to books. We celebrate the achievements of authors. We provide writers at all stages of their careers with the tools and resources they need to write. And we give readers access to the best writers from around the world."

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society_of_Literature): "The Royal Society of Literature (RSL) is a learned society founded in 1820, by King George IV, to 'reward literary merit and excite literary talent'. A charity that represents the voice of literature in the UK, the RSL has about 600 Fellows, elected from among the best writers in any genre currently at work. Additionally, Honorary Fellows are chosen from those who have made a significant contribution to the advancement of literature, including publishers, agents, librarians, booksellers or producers. The society is a cultural tenant at London's Somerset House."
