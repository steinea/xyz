"Welcome to SPAG, the Society for the Promotion of Adventure Games magazine. Founded in 1994 by G. Kevin Wilson, SPAG has been a pillar of the Interactive Fiction community for almost two decades, and weâ€™re proud to still be doing our part for this vibrant art form. Interactive Fiction (IF) is one of the oldest forms of computer entertainment, and every year pushes its boundaries further; although the first IF works were indeed games about adventurers, today most are not, and it makes much more sense to talk about IF stories or works rather than IF games. Instead what binds the community together is a love for words and a curiosity to explore interactivity in a way traditional genres cannot."
