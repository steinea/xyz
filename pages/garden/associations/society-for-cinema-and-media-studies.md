"The Society for Cinema and Media Studies is a community of individuals and institutions actively engaged with the study of the moving image. SCMS is dedicated to encouraging and rewarding excellence in scholarship and writing, to facilitating and improving the teaching of media studies as a discipline, and to advancing multicultural awareness and interaction. SCMS is an organization that works best with the support of its members, and we invite students, scholars and others interested in cinema and media to join our community as individual or institutional members."
