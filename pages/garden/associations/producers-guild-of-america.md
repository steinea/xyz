"The Producers Guild of America represents over 8,400 producers. It is a non-profit trade organization that represents, protects and promotes the interests of all members of the producing team in film, television and emerging media.

The Guild invests in its core values that benefit the industry at large. These values are rooted in facilitating employment for its members, advocating for sustainable practices in production that minimize human and environmental harm, and ensuring a set culture that advances safety and creates viable pathways into the guild for the next generation of producers, particularly those from populations under-represented in the industry. Year-round it hosts a number of educational, mentoring and professional networking programs, as well as industry events that honor excellence in producing."
