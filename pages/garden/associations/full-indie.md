"Full Indie is run by game devs, for game devs. We’re a nonprofit that builds community in Vancouver’s indie gaming scene by organizing monthly meetups and the annual Full Indie Summit, returning on September 21, 2024. Our meetups allow indies to demo their games, get feedback, and meet with like-minded people in an inclusive space. To be notified of our next events, please join us on Meetup!"
