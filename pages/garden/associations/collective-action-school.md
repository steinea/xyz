"Collective Action School (formerly known as Logic School) is an online, experimental school for tech workers produced by Logic Foundation with support from Processing Foundation.

Our curriculum draws from the worlds of activism, design, and software engineering. Our program cultivates critical thinking about technology and its impact. We are a community built school.

Collective Action School has a grassroots theory of change. We believe the people who make the tech industry run—its workers—have the power to not only transform it, but to build and imagine new technologies.

At Collective Action School, we’re guided by the idea of “underlying conditions” – what are the underlying conditions that have grown the world we live in now? What are the underlying conditions we need to create, to live in the world we want? We believe technology (from the distributed web to ancestral technologies) has a role to play in answering these questions."
