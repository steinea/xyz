"The Economic Sociology and Political Economy community (ES/PE), founded and led by Dr. Oleg Komlik, is a global online scholarly community which brings together academics, students, practitioners and activists interested in these fields of study and life. Our primary purpose is to disseminate the insights of socio-political research on economies and economics to the public, academics and policymakers.

The community was established in June 2011 and since then has become a unique source of knowledge and widely recognized virtual venue for interaction among more than 80,000 members from about 165 countries: researchers, faculty, students, state bureaucrats, journalists, entrepreneurs, activists, and anyone who is interested in socio-political analysis of the economy and economic organizations. We provide online platforms on which community members satisfy their curiosity, find academic resources, publish their work, share relevant information, exchange ideas, and create collaborations.

Original essays, reviews of illuminating books and important articles, thought-provoking quotes and excerpts, interesting posts from media outlets, instructive videos and podcasts, as well as great academic opportunities (calls for papers, fellowships, job openings, and more) â€“ are regularly being brought to the attention of our followers; and all these related to topics in Economic Sociology, Political Economy, Social Study of Markets and Finance, Law and Political Economy, Labor and Welfare, and Sociology of Economics.

We firmly stand for the 'from knowledge to policy' approach and intellectual activism, and call for public engagement of scholars."
