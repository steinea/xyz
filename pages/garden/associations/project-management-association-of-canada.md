"In a world where project management is becoming a vital force for innovation and organizational behaviour, it is incumbent upon those within the profession to maintain a community in which diversity, creativity and open-mindedness are its hallmarks. PMAC-AGPC members believe that Canada represents these ideals and is, as a result, ideally positioned to serve a new assembly of project managers as it faces unique new challenges in the coming years. Canada is unique in its ability to serve both a national people and an international stage. It has obligations to both and, unlike many, the capacity to deliver to both. PMAC-AGPC has the same unique challenge and sees itself being able to reach it from the beginning."
