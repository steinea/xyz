"The purpose of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association is to promote, advance, and support science fiction and fantasy writing in the United States and elsewhere, by educating and informing the general public and supporting and empowering science fiction and fantasy writers. We host the prestigious Nebula Awards at our annual SFWA Nebula Conference, assist members in various legal disputes, offer the Speakers Bureau, administer grants to SFF community organizations and members facing medical or legal expenses."
