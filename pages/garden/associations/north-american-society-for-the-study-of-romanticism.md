"The North American Society for the Study of Romanticism (NASSR) was founded at the University of Western Ontario in 1991 by a group of faculty members and graduate students. NASSR was established to provide a forum for the discussion of a wide variety of theoretical approaches to Romantic works of all genres and disciplines.  NASSR members from North America, Asia, Europe, and Australia work in a wide range of disciplines, including History, Art History, Women's Studies, Philosophy, Music, Political Economy, and Literature; their interests encompass American, Canadian, English, French, German, Irish, Italian, Russian, Scottish, and Spanish Romanticism."
