"The Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness (ASSC) is an American non-profit organization for professional membership that aims to encourage research on consciousness in cognitive science, neuroscience, philosophy, and other relevant disciplines. The association aims to advance research about the nature, function, and underlying mechanisms of consciousness.

The organization was created in 1994 in Berkeley. The original aim of the organization was to act as a framework by which the international academic community could generate meetings devoted to the academic study of consciousness. The original founding members included Bernard Baars, William Banks, George Buckner, David Chalmers, Stanley Klein, Bruce Mangan, Thomas Metzinger, David Rosenthal, and Patrick Wilken. Since 1994, the organization has put on eleven meetings and assumed many other activities, including an e-print archive and an online journal *Psyche*. The *Psyche* journal is no longer active."
