"The Canadian Game Studies Association (CGSA/ACÃ‰J) is an organization dedicated to the interdisciplinary study of digital games. Its primary goal is to support the work of Canadian researchers, graduate students, artists, game designers, programmers, theorists, and others working in this field. CGSA will also attempt to provide opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration and cross-disciplinary support for its members, in part, through Loading: A Journal of the Canadian Game Studies Association and our annual conference."
