> For nearly fifty years, the Institute for Social Ecology has offered experiential radical education for grassroots organizing and community-building: out of our home base in north-central Vermont, online, and with host partners around North America. We are tireless movement educators for direct democracy, social revolution, and reharmonizing human society with the rest of nature.
