"The purpose of a system is what it does (POSIWID) is a systems thinking heuristic coined by [Stafford Beer](/stafford-beer/), who observed that there is 'no point in claiming that the purpose of a system is to do what it constantly fails to do.' The term is widely used by systems theorists, and is generally invoked to counter the notion that the purpose of a system can be read from the intentions of those who design, operate, or promote it. When a system's side effects or unintended consequences reveal that its behavior is poorly understood, then the POSIWID perspective can balance political understandings of system behavior with a more straightforwardly descriptive view."
