### Managing for organizational excellence

Another perspective is to view organizational excellence as the successful integration of technology, infrastructure, and personnel to achieve a common goal or mission.

1. Information: Metrics, measures, and decision support
2. Structure: Roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities of each functional area
3. People: Total human capital within the organization
4. Rewards: Compensation and incentives
5. Learning systems: Knowledge and training to continuously improve skills
6. Work processes: Interaction and linkage of workflows"
