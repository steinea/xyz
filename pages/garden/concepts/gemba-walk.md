"Genba (現場, also romanized as gemba) is a term used in business for the location where value is created, such as a factory floor, construction site, or sales floor.

...

Toyota executive Taiichi Ohno developed the gemba walk as a way for staff to stand back from day-to-day tasks and walk the floor of their workplace to identify wasteful activities. The objective of gemba walk is to understand the value stream and its problems rather than review results or make superficial comments. Along with Genchi Genbutsu or 'Go, Look, See', gemba walk is one of the 5 Lean guiding principles that should be practiced by Lean leaders on a daily basis. The gemba walk, is an activity that takes management to the front lines to look for waste and opportunities to practice gemba kaizen, or practical shopfloor improvement."
