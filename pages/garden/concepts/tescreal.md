"TESCREAL is an acronym neologism proposed by computer scientist Timnit Gebru and philosopher Ã‰mile P. Torres that stands for "Transhumanism, Extropianism, Singularitarianism, (modern) Cosmism, Rationalism, Effective Altruism, and Longtermism". Gebru and Torres argue that these ideologies should be treated as an 'interconnected and overlapping' group with shared origins. They claim these constitute a movement that allows its proponents to use the threat of human extinction to justify expensive or detrimental projects and consider it pervasive in social and academic circles in Silicon Valley centered around artificial intelligence. As such, the acronym is sometimes used to criticize a perceived belief system associated with Big Tech."
