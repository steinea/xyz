"A software development process prescribes a process for developing software. It typically divides an overall effort into smaller steps or sub-processes that are intended to ensure high-quality results. The process may describe specific deliverables â€“ artifacts to be created and completed.

... The structured systems analysis and design method (SSADM) was produced for the UK government Office of Government Commerce in the 1980s.

.... Other methodologies were devised later:

1970s

* Structured programming since 1969
* Cap Gemini SDM, originally from PANDATA, the first English translation was published in 1974. SDM stands for System Development Methodology

1980s

* Structured systems analysis and design method (SSADM) from 1980 onwards
* Information Requirement Analysis/Soft systems methodology

1990s

* Object-oriented programming (OOP) developed in the early 1960s and became a dominant programming approach during the mid-1990s
* Rapid application development (RAD), since 1991
* Dynamic systems development method (DSDM), since 1994
* Scrum, since 1995
* Team software process, since 1998
* Rational Unified Process (RUP), maintained by IBM since 1998
* Extreme programming, since 1999

2000s

* Agile Unified Process (AUP) maintained since 2005 by Scott Ambler
* Disciplined agile delivery (DAD) Supersedes AUP

2010s

* Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)
* Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS)
* DevOps

Since DSDM in 1994, all of the methodologies on the above list except RUP have been agile methodologies - yet many organizations, especially governments, still use pre-agile processes (often waterfall or similar). "
