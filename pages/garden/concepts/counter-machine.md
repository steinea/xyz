"A counter machine or counter automaton is an abstract machine used in a formal logic and theoretical computer science to model computation. It is the most primitive of the four types of register machines. A counter machine comprises a set of one or more unbounded registers, each of which can hold a single non-negative integer, and a list of (usually sequential) arithmetic and control instructions for the machine to follow. The counter machine is typically used in the process of designing parallel algorithms in relation to the mutual exclusion principle. When used in this manner, the counter machine is used to model the discrete time-steps of a computational system in relation to memory accesses. By modeling computations in relation to the memory accesses for each respective computational step, parallel algorithms may be designed in such a matter to avoid interlocking, the simultaneous writing operation by two (or more) threads to the same memory address."

[Register Machine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_machine): "In mathematical logic and theoretical computer science, a register machine is a generic class of abstract machines, analogous to a Turing machine and thus Turing complete. Unlike a Turing machine that uses a tape and head, a register machine utilizes multiple uniquely addressed registers to store non-negative integers. There are several sub-classes of register machines, including counter machines, pointer machines, random-access machines (RAM), and Random-Access Stored-Program Machine (RASP), each varying in complexity. These machines, particularly in theoretical studies, help in understanding computational processes. The concept of register machines can also be applied to virtual machines in practical computer science, for educational purposes and reducing dependency on specific hardware architectures."

"There are at least four sub-classes found in the literature. In ascending order of complexity:

* Counter machine – the most primitive and reduced theoretical model of computer hardware. This machine lacks indirect addressing, and instructions are in the finite state machine in the manner of the Harvard architecture.

* Pointer machine – a blend of the counter machine and RAM models with less common and more abstract than either model. Instructions are in the finite state machine in the manner of Harvard architecture.

* Random-access machine (RAM) – a counter machine with indirect addressing and, usually, an augmented instruction set. Instructions are in the finite state machine in the manner of the Harvard architecture.

* Random-access stored-program machine model (RASP) – a RAM with instructions in its registers analogous to the Universal Turing machine, making it an example of the von Neumann architecture. But unlike a computer, the model is idealized with effectively infinite registers (and if used, effectively infinite special registers such as accumulators). As compared to a modern computer, however, the instruction set is still reduced in number and complexity."
