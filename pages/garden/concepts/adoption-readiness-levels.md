"Addressing technical challenges is necessary but not sufficient to successfully commercialize and scale a new technology. Technology commercialization also requires addressing non-technical market and adoption challenges.

The Adoption Readiness Level (ARL) framework can help identify adoption risks and opportunities and support the successful commercialization of new technologies.

The Adoption Readiness Level framework is a commercialization guideâ€”covering a comprehensive range of adoption risks that technologies can face. Identifying and addressing adoption risks early and often can accelerate technology commercialization.

The ARL framework is a tool to assess the commercialization risks facing a technology as it crosses the Research, Development, Demonstration, and Deployment (RDD&D) continuum to reach successful commercialization. The ARL framework complements the widely adopted [Technology Readiness Levels](/technology-readiness-levels/) (TRL) framework by extending beyond the technical risks that technologies face on their commercialization journeys to capture other commercialization risks. It consists of 17 dimensions that fall into four risk buckets:"
