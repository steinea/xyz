"PDCA or plan–do–check–act (sometimes called plan–do–check–adjust) is an iterative design and management method used in business for the control and continual improvement of processes and products. It is also known as the Shewhart cycle, or the control circle/cycle ... The cycle is sometimes referred to as the Shewhart / Deming cycle since it originated with physicist [Walter Shewhart](/walter-a-shewhart/){: .internal-link} at the Bell Telephone Laboratories in the 1920s. [W. Edwards Deming](/w-edwards-deming/){: .internal-link} modified the Shewhart cycle in the 1940s and subsequently applied it to management practices in Japan in the 1950s."
