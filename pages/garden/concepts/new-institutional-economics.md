"New Institutional Economics (NIE) is an economic perspective that attempts to extend economics by focusing on the institutions (that is to say the social and legal norms and rules) that underlie economic activity and with analysis beyond earlier [institutional economics](/institutional-economics/) and neoclassical economics. Unlike neoclassical economics, it also considers the role of culture and classical political economy in economic development."
