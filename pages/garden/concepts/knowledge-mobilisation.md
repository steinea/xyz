"Knowledge mobilisation strategies are about sharing knowledge between different communities to create new knowledge and catalyse change. Knowledge mobilisation is a two-way process and views knowledge as a process not as a product ... Knowledge mobilisation involves a two-way dialogue between researchers (research producers) and research users. It begins from the outset of a study, when a research question is first being developed, and continues beyond the dissemination of findings."
