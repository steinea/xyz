"A landscape of practice (LoP) is a social sciences concept introduced by Etienne Wenger-Trayner and Beverly Wenger-Trayner in a 2014 book [*Learning in Landscapes of Practice*].

The concept is related to [networks of practice](/network-of-practice/) (often abbreviated as NoP), originated by John Seely Brown and Paul Duguid [in *The Social Life of Information*]. This concept, related to the work on [communities of practice](/community-of-practice/) by Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger, refers to a number of related communities working on a [body of knowledge](/body-of-knowledge/) (BoK). Participation in a LoP involves members of related CoPs developing competence in their area of interest and keeping up to date with knowledgeability relevant to the LoP."
