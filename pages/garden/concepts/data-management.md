"Data management comprises all disciplines related to handling data as a valuable resource, it is the practice of managing an organization's data so it can be analyzed for decision making.

The concept of data management emerged alongside the evolution of computing technology. In the 1950s, as computers became more prevalent, organizations began to grapple with the challenge of organizing and storing data efficiently. Early methods relied on punch cards and manual sorting, which were labor-intensive and prone to errors. The introduction of database management systems in the 1970s marked a significant milestone, enabling structured storage and retrieval of data.

By the 1980s, relational database models revolutionized data management, emphasizing the importance of data as an asset and fostering a data-centric mindset in business. This era also saw the rise of data governance practices, which prioritized the organization and regulation of data to ensure quality and compliance. Over time, advancements in technology, such as cloud computing and big data analytics, have further refined data management, making it a cornerstone of modern business operations.

As of 2025, data management encompasses a wide range of practices, from data storage and security to analytics and decision-making, reflecting its critical role in driving innovation and efficiency across industries.

The Data Management Body of Knowledge, DMBoK, developed by the Data Management Association, DAMA, outlines key knowledge areas that serve as the foundation for modern data management practices, suggesting a framework for organizations to manage data as a strategic asset."
