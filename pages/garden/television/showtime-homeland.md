"Homeland (stylized as HOMƎLAND) is an American espionage thriller television series developed by Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa. Based on the Israeli series Prisoners of War (Hebrew: חטופים, romanized: Hatufim, literally 'Abductees'), it was created by Gideon Raff, who also serves as an executive producer on Homeland. The series stars Claire Danes as Carrie Mathison, a CIA officer with bipolar disorder, convinced that decorated Marine Corps scout sniper Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis) was 'turned' by al-Qaeda and poses a threat to the United States. The series storyline grows from that premise, together with Mathison's ongoing covert work."
