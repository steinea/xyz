From [Wired](https://www.wired.com/review/analogue-duo/):

"There's a good chance you've never played one, much less seen one, but the PC Engine—branded in the US as the TurboGrafx-16—is a game console that arrived at a unique moment in gaming history. A bona-fide Nintendo-threatening hit in its home country of Japan when it launched there in the late 1980s, this system from computer maker NEC and game company Hudson Soft (makers of Bomberman) could have changed the gaming landscape. But in the US, the console was quickly overshadowed by the Sega Genesis, which launched around the same time.

Thankfully, all those long-neglected PC Engine and TurboGrafx-16 games are being given another chance. Since finally launching its first handheld system, hardware maker Analogue is taking a crack at the PC Engine, giving its software a home suitable for the 21st century."
