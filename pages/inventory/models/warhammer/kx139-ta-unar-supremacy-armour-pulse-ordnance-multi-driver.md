"A recent development of T'au pulse technology, this triple-barrelled Pulse Ordnance Multi-driver uses powerful induction fields to propel a variety of heavy munitions with great force and precision. Fired in rapid volleys, this mix of high explosive and kinetic projectiles can be used to either saturate a single target with concentrated bombardments, or shower a wider area with arcing trajectories to equally devastating effect

The Pulse Ordnance Multi-driver is a primary weapon of the KX139 Ta'unar Supremacy Armour, which is available to buy separately. This multi-part resin kit includes the all of parts needed to build the weapons system and mount it on the Supremacy Armour's upper torso.

This resin modelling kit is not a toy – it is a collectible item and construction should only be undertaken by expert Warhammer hobbyists aged 15 years and over.

This kit is supplied unpainted and requires assembly – we recommend using Citadel paints."
