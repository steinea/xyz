"The T'au Heavy Rail Cannon Array is the most powerful armament yet developed to be mounted on the KX139 Ta'unar Supremacy Armour without structural damage being incurred from its use. It was created to eliminate the toughest enemy targets at extreme range.

The main weapon’s fearsome power is such that it must be used judiciously, a factor which lead to the addition of the Fragmentation Cluster Shell Launcher - a secondary weapon system for close range defence and infantry target saturation. Though part of the same array, these weapons may be targeted and fire independently, in the same way as the KX139's other secondary weapon systems.

The Heavy Rail Cannon Array is a primary weapon of the KX139 Ta’unar Supremacy Armour. This multi-part resin kit includes the all of parts needed to build the weapons system and mount it on the Supremacy Armour’s upper torso."
