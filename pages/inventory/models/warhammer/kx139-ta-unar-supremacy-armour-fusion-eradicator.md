"Designed as a radical solution to the limitations of current T'au fusion weapons technology, the Fusion Eradicator combines a battery of multiple synchronised firing chambers. The weapon creates a blast of energy so potent that solid matter caught in its path is torn apart at a molecular level by brute thermal force, and no physical material yet known to the T'au can survive its destructive power.

The cost in materials and expertise to create a single Fusion Eradicator is immense, and the natural endurance of each weapon is limited often to a single battle. Each Fusion Eradicator is then discarded and must be replaced.

The Fusion Eradicator is an arm-mounted weapon for the KX139 Ta'unar Supremacy Armour, which is available to buy separately. This multi-part resin kit includes the mounting arm and shoulder plate and can be built for either the left or right side of the Supremacy Armour.

This resin modelling kit is not a toy – it is a collectible item and construction should only be undertaken by expert Warhammer hobbyists aged 15 years and over.

This kit is supplied unpainted and requires assembly – we recommend using Citadel paints."
