"Aggressive and rebellious, Commander O'Shovah is an undisputed master of Mont'ka, the T'au metastrategy of the Killing Blow. Piloting his crimson battlesuit, he carves a bloody path into the enemy, leading his separatist Fire Caste forces from the front as he wields the enigmatic Dawn Blade with such strength and skill that no foe can stand against him.

This multipart plastic kit builds Commander Farsight, leader to the breakaway Farsight Enclaves of the T'au Empire. His custom XV-86 Supernova battlesuit features advanced technology that provides greater agility and mobility, allowing him to put his prodigious skills with the blade to good use. Farsight wields the mysterious Dawn Blade in one hand, with a plasma rifle and shield generator mounted to his other arm. This legendary figure's wargear is loaded with details, from the ritual bonding knife strapped on his leg to the Farsight Enclaves icon worked into his shield's surface. His heroic pose atop a dramatic scenic base make Commander Farsight an eye-catching centrepiece for any collection or army.

This kit comprises 48 plastic components, and comes with a Citadel 60mm Round Base. This miniature is supplied unpainted and requires assembly â€“ we recommend using Citadel Plastic Glue and Citadel Colour paints."
