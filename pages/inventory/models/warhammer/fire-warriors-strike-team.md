"Not only is the path ahead illuminated by the light of the Greater Good, but also the glow of pulse rifles. The courageous Fire Warriors, with the absolute, zealous belief in the destiny of their race, fight with unstoppable fervour and enviable skill. Benefiting from the astonishing rate of technological advance displayed by T'au engineers, their armour is lightweight yet durable and their weaponry reliable yet powerful. A Fire Warrior Strike Team is a high-speed detachment of shock troops who lay down sheets of withering pulse rifle fire, throwing electromagnetic pulse grenades and aiming powerful tactical support turrets at a rapidly-depleting foe.

This multi-part plastic kit gives you everything you need to build ten T'au Empire Fire Warriors, in their Strike Team configuration. One model may be upgraded to a Shas'ui, and the kit includes two drones, a DS8 tactical support turret, a selection of different shoulder pads and back packs and a choice of weapons - pulse pistols, pulse carbines, EMP and photon grenades! 230 components in total, with ten Citadel 25mm Round bases, one Citadel 40mm Round base and two small flying bases.

This kit can also be assembled as a Fire Warriors Breacher Team.

These miniatures are supplied unpainted and require assembly â€“ we recommend using Citadel Plastic Glue and Citadel Colour paints."
