"The Ethereal caste are the serene spiritual leaders of the T’au, embodying the wisdom and unity of the Greater Good. In times of war, more fervent Ethereals take to the field in person, living icons who inspire their armies to achieve impossible feats. Armed with ceremonial weapons, they skim above the battle aboard hover drones and invoke the fundamental might of the T’au castes.

This multipart plastic kit builds an Ethereal – a wise leader for the T'au Empire. Clad in austere robes and protected by armour adorned with the Ethereal caste's icon, this inspiring figure carries a ritual honour stave to defend themselves while guiding their followers. They can also stand atop a hover drone, floating over the havoc of combat.

This kit includes 10 plastic components and a Citadel 40mm Round Base.

This miniature is supplied unpainted and requires assembly – we recommend using Citadel Plastic Glue and Citadel Colour paints."
