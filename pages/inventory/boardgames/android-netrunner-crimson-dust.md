#### Abstract

"With the sixty new cards (three copies each of twenty unique cards) in Crimson Dust, the final Data Pack in the "Red Sand" cycle for Android: Netrunner, the forces that are vying for control of Mars are confronted with the consequences of their conflict. Lives have been lost. Homes have been destroyed. And now an entire world may be vulnerable to the terrorist forces of the Crimson Dust!"
