#### Abstract

"This expansion adds two new factions, the CHOAM and the Richese, to the Dune boardgame, along with 2 new variants.

The Combine Honnete Ober Advancer Mercantiles or CHOAM controlled much of the economic affairs across the cosmos, and had a keen interest in Arrakis above and beyond spice production. Because of its control of inter-planetary commerce, CHOAM was the largest single source of wealth in the Imperium. Influence in CHOAM was a major focus of political maneuvering in the Imperium, both to maximize dividends and also to skim profits. The leaders and bureaucrats of CHOAM were dedicated to controlling vital products that enriched the Great Houses . . . and CHOAM itself.

House Richese, just like the Ixians, had a well-earned reputation for ingenuity, and created important technological inventions. But Count Ilban Richese suffered a number of business blunders that threatened to bankrupt their fortunes. After being ousted from governing Arrakis, they were reduced to selling off important creations simply to raise enough funds to continue their efforts to compete.

This expansion also introduces Leader Skills, which let you assign a skill like Mentat, Swordmaster of Ginaz, or Prana Bindu Adept to one of your leader discs. It also included Advanced Stronghold Cards, which give you a "homefield advantage" when battling in a stronghold you control."
