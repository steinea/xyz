#### Abstract

"Enter the haunted corridors of The Mysterious Manor! Here there are few heroes. Instead, each player takes on a unique role, with dramatically different abilities and goals. Play as the pious Paladin, the murderous Skeletons, the dreaded Spider, the beguiling Warlock, or the Manor itself. With dozens of player configurations, a modular board, and rules allowing players to integrate content from Vast: The Crystal Caverns, Mysterious Manor offers new and old players alike fresh new adventures in the world of Vast!"
