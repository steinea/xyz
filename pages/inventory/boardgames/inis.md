#### Abstract

"Inis is a game deeply rooted in Celtic history and lore in which you’ll lead your tribe to victory by being elected King, or Queen, of the island.

You’ll draft action cards each turn to put your tribe in the best position, and hinder your opponents’ progress. There are multiple paths to victory and many strategies to pursue as you spread your influence over the lands."
