#### Abstract

"The Automata Initiative is the first set of the Liberation Cycle, which is set in Brazil. As the population is in uproar over proposed legislation to remove rights of personhood from bioroids comes before the National Congress, a broad coalition of Runners struggle to expose the involvement of the Corps.

The Automata Initiative contains 65 brand-new cards, including four identities, and introduces the brand new Threat mechanic to Netrunner."
