#### Abstract

"Contains forty-five detailed miniatures, four new Skeletons, and two brand new roles you can add to Vast: The Mysterious Manor:

Armored Knight - Bolstered by new weapons and relics, you prepare yourself for whatever awaits in the Manor.

Shadow Paladin - Shackled by misfortune, you work to contort the rooms of the Manor into a labyrinth of your own design.

More Skeletons! - Singy, Shiny, Smashy, and Sniffy join the skeleton crew offering new options in their pursuit of the incessant hero."
