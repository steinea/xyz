#### Abstract

"The Clockwork Expansion 2 is a standalone expansion that lets you square off against four automated factions. Add one to round out a game with few players, or team up in cooperative play!

Each bot has four difficulty levels and four trait cards, giving them special powers and strategic quirks. Also included is a new Better Bot trait card for each faction from the first Clockwork Expansion."
