#### Abstract

"Need allies? Here they are, fiery and fierce. Discover unique strategies and make the Woodland wilder by adding hirelings. Best with fewer players, great with more!

Hirelings can be added to games at any player count. With fewer players, the hirelings add new pieces to the map, ramping up the tension and giving you more tactical options. With more players, some hireling cards will flip over to reveal new special abilities to gain, letting you explore unique and powerful strategies.

The Hirelings Box is an easy way to store and organize all your hirelings, and the Marauder Hirelings Pack includes three sets of hirelings."
