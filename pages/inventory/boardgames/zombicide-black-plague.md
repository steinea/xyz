#### Abstract

"Zombicide: Black Plague is a standalone cooperative board game for 1 to 6 players that brings the relentless zombie-killing action of Zombicide into a brand new fantasy setting, featuring different Survivors from all walks of medieval life and even some fantasy races like dwarves and elves! Each of these heroes possess their own unique abilities to face the zombie horde, from familiar skills to all-new ones! Players control a party of Survivors as they fight to rid the land of an invasion of the fearsome horde of zombies raised and controlled by Necromancers. Survivors find weapons, learn spells, battle zombies, and gain experience. The more experienced they get, the more powerful they become, but the more zombies rise to face them!"
