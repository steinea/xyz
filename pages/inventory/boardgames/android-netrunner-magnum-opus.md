#### Abstract

"The Magnum Opus set was released near the end of 2018, featuring six cards designed by winners of some of the most prestigious tournaments. It was only available to people who were able to attend the Magnum Opus event. Since then, many players have found it hard to get hold of the set, so we have re-released it with brand new art, updated wording, and modernized templates and glyphs."
