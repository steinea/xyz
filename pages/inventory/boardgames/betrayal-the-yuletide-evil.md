#### Abstract

"A festive-themed expansion for Betrayal at House on the Hill 3rd Edition. Adds two new Rooms, Items, and Events, and two unique characters controlled by a single player: Jingleklaws and Elf, who start the game on the Upper Landing and have unique abilities. Comes with a new Scenario card featuring 5 new Haunts based on Jingleklaws and the holidays."
