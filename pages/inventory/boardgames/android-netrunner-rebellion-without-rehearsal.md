#### Abstract

"Rebellion Without Rehearsal is the second half of the Liberation Cycle. It concludes the story began in The Automata Initiative, in which the passage of a law set to strip bioroids of personhood caused uproar throughout Brazil. As the protests turn violent, and only the President’s signature is needed for this law to be enacted, the activists striving to protect bioroid rights make unlikely alliances and decide how far they’re willing to go.

Rebellion Without Rehearsal contains full playsets of 65 new Netrunner cards, including three identities."
