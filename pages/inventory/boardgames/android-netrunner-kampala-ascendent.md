#### Abstract

"Kampala Ascendent finishes the Kitara Cycle, introducing a piece of hardware that allows you to spend a click to receive a credit and two cards, an operation that can eliminate three of a runner’s clicks on a turn, a new Jinteki identity that invites the runners into their servers, and so much more.

Complete your journey into the SSL with Kampala Ascendent!"
