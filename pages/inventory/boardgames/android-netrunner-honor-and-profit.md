#### Abstract

"'Money is honest. Credits may be cold, uncaring, heartless abstractions, but they offer an unavoidable truth: The more, the better.' –Iain Stirling

The network lies before you; which path will you take? Focusing primarily on the interests of Jinteki and three new Criminal runners, Honor and Profit is a deluxe expansion for Android: Netrunner - The Card Game. Its 165 new cards (three copies each of fifty-five different cards) feature a dizzying array of new tricks and traps, events to alter the tempo of the game, new psi talents, and six new identity cards that engender the exploration of all-new deck-building strategies. Additionally, fans of every faction will discover plenty to love among the expansion's neutral ambushes, ice, ops, AI, and connections."
