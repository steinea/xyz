#### Abstract

"In Android: Netrunner - What Lies Ahead, the first Data Pack in the "Genesis Cycle", its sixty cards (three copies each of twenty different cards) expand the base game, adding muscle and theme to each of the Core Set's seven different factions. The Corps each receive a new agenda and flavorful piece of ice while the Runners launch into the ongoing cyberstruggles with new icebreakers and support cards. Additionally, the Anarch and Haas-Bioroid factions each pursue new interests with a new identity card, and the new Anarch identity – Whizzard – provides Anarch players a whole depth of new strategies based around trashing the cards they access."
