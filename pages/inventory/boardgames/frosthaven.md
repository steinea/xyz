#### Abstract

"Frosthaven is a standalone adventure from the designer and publisher of Gloomhaven that features seventeen new characters, three new ancestries, more than twenty new enemies, more than one hundred new items, and a new, 138-scenario campaign. Characters and items from Gloomhaven will be usable in Frosthaven, and vice versa.

In addition to having the well-known combat mechanisms of Gloomhaven, Frosthaven features much more to do outside of combat, such as numerous mysteries to solve, a seasonal event system to live through, and player control over how this ramshackle village expands, with each new building offering new ways to progress."
