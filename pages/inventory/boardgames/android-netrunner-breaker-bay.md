#### Abstract

"Breaker Bay, the second Data Pack in the "SanSan Cycle" for Android: Netrunner, continues the cycle's guided tour of the SanSan region with sixty new cards (three copies each of twenty different cards) focusing on the University of the Californias at Breaker Bay and its students. New resources, programs, and operations reflect everything from their living conditions to their parties, as well as the knowledge they hope to obtain and the efforts the world's largest megacorps make to recruit the best and brightest of them."
