#### Abstract

"From the award-winning game designer of Root and Oath, Cole Wehrle brings you into an interactive history lesson about life on the edge of empire.

For generations the Durrani Empire held the region together. Now, their authority has collapsed. Rivals both old and new have emerged from the shadows. Itâ€™s up to the players to see if a fledgling Afghan state might come into being."
