#### Abstract

"Parhelion is the second set of the Borealis Cycle, which began with Midnight Sun. The hackers, thieves, and eco-terrorists of the Arctic have wounded the corporations; in return, the corporations lash out, hunting down the perpetrators.

Parhelion contains 63 brand-new cards, including four new identities, and expands on the mechanical ideas introduced in Midnight Sun."
