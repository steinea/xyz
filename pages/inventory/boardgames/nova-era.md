#### Abstract

"Human civilization has taken many forms. Now, you can be in charge of one. But be warned. There are other civilizations, worldwide Disasters, and Dark Ages. How will you grow your Civilization?

In Nova Era, players develop their civilization by expanding their territories, enlisting famous personalities, and researching technologies to become the most advanced civilization. But watch out for disasters, social unrest, and decisions that may cause a Dark Age!

Only the smartest Ruler will create the most successful civilization!"
