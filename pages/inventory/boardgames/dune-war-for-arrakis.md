#### Abstract

"Dune: War for Arrakis is a thematic strategy board game centered around the Desert War events from the acclaimed Dune novel by Frank Herbert.

In this asymmetric game, House Harkonnen must dominate Arrakis with its troops and keep the spice flowing, lest they lose the support of the great powers of the Imperium. Meanwhile, the young Atreides leader-turned-messiah, Paul-Muadâ€™Dib, must lead the Fremen rebels and wrestle with his prescient visions, finding his path between the fate of Arrakis, the inexorable jihad, and the destiny of the Kwisatz Haderach. While the Harkonnens rely on their vehicles, like Ornithopters and Carryalls, to move their forces and avoid the dangers of the desert, the Atreides harness desert power, riding the colossal Sandworms into battle. Each faction employs different strategies, complemented by their unique Leaders and sets of Planning Cards, to achieve their own victory conditions."
