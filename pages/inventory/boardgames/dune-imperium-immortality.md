#### Abstract

"Immortality is the second expansion for the award-winning worker-placement-meets-deck-building board game Dune: Imperium:

As the Great Houses wage war, the Bene Tleilax advance their own agenda by trading in genetic innovations. Will you hire Face Dancer spies of unmatched skill? Regrow damaged tissue and organs? Or dare to employ people restored to life as gholas?

Immortality expands Dune: Imperium in new directions. Make shadowy deals with the Tleilaxu to harvest genetic specimens. Unlock the potential of scientific research. Graft cards together to empower your Agents.

Explore a universe of possibilities with Dune: Imperium – Immortality."
