#### Abstract

"In Wilmotʼs Warehouse, your team will work cooperatively to organize the warehouse, using memory, imagination, and silly stories you make up.

DRAW Product tiles off the stack, DISCUSS what they look like, then PLACE them somewhere youʼll remember. 

After you place each tile, you flip it over and canʼt look at it again until the end of the game. So your team has to remember where you placed previous tiles as you decide where to place new ones. At the end of the game, in a 5-minute rush, your team will have to match all 35 face down tiles with customer cards. Consult your performance review to see how you did!"
