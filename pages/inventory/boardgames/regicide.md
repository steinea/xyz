#### Abstract

"This new edition of Regicide comes in a hardy, plastic, flip-top box to keep your cards safe and secure!

Also featuring the Bards as the new art for the Diamonds suit. All illustrations have been touched up and improved with extra detail.

Card backs now match the deck box colour! No more teal card backs with your red deck box. And lastly, card backs now feature a bold border. This will help players easily identify the number of cards in other players' hands at a glance.

Regicide is a cooperative, fantasy card game for 1 to 4 players, with a deck of playing cards uniquely illustrated by Sketchgoblin.

Recruit heroes, storm the castle and defeat the corrupted Monarchy!

In Regicide players must work together and use the unique powers of each suit to achieve victory."
