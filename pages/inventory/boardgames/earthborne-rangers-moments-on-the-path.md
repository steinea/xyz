#### Abstract

"Moments on the Path adds new cards to the path deck in the form of ephemeral moments, narrative choices, and attachments.

The cards in this expansion capture fleeting moments in time--moments like catching the scent of flowers on the breeze, hearing a tree fall somewhere in the distance, or encountering a predator with unique characteristics--adding texture to the emergent narrative."
