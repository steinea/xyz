#### Abstract

"Escape the Dark Castle is a simple, fantasy adventure game with a focus on atmosphere and player cooperation â€“ perfect for newcomers to tabletop gaming. It takes 2 minutes to set up, lasts around 30 minutes, and no two games are ever the same.   

Players take the roles of prisoners and must work together using custom dice and item cards to overcome the castle's many horrors, traps and challenges - each of which is represented by a large, beautifully illustrated chapter card.

As these immersive chapter cards are revealed one by one, the game takes on the form of a shared storytelling experience, with the players making decisions about what to do each chapter as they embark on a desperate quest to escape.

The goal of the game is to complete every chapter in the castle deck, and then defeat the final boss. To win, you must keep everyone alive - if any prisoner is killed the game ends immediately."
