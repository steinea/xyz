#### Abstract

"With the sixty new cards (three copies each of twenty unique cards) in Free Mars, the fifth data pack in the "Red Sands" cycle for the Android: Netrunner living card game, it's time to see how far the Clans and their Runner allies will go to keep Mars for Martians! So strap a milspec laser to your exosuit and call in every favor you can because the revolution is here!"
