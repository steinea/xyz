#### Abstract

"Reign and Reverie is a 156 card-expansion (with three copies of 49-new cards and nine unique one-of cards) featuring new tools for all ten factions in Android: Netrunner – The Card Game while exploring the urban metropolis of ChiLo, a beacon of light in the Midwest. This includes a new identity for all seven major factions, a new console for every major runner faction, and new agendas for every corp. Because Reign and Reverie features new cards for all ten factions, it is the perfect companion piece to the Revised Core Set released late 2017."
