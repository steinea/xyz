#### Abstract

"Venus might just be the deadliest world in the solar system… but it has potential! Up among the corrosive clouds, far away from the scorching hot surface, humans have begun colonizing and terraforming. Your corporation has a good opportunity to make a name for itself; build flying cities, shade off the sun to lessen the greenhouse effect, and introduce life to this planet! – And let Venus help you terraform Mars!"
