#### Abstract

"Delve deeper into the world of root with the Underworld Expansion, which adds two new factions and a new board.

Play as the:

Underground Duchy – Sway your ministers to lead a righteous expedition to the Woodland, bringing order to the unending war and chaos above.

Corvid Conspiracy – Use cunning and trickery to hold the Woodland hostage, instigating plots to seize control through terror.

Play on the:

Mountain Map – Trek across outcroppings, clear blocked routes, and hold the mountain pass to show you are an effective leader.

Lake Map – Whisk yourself across the map by travelling on the ferry, meeting new friends and allies along the way."
