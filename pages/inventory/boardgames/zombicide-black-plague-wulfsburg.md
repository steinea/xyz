#### Abstract

"Zombicide: Wulfsburg is a blood-curdling expansion for the Zombicide: Black Plague board game! The strongest and smartest among us only survived through mass zombicide. However, rumors persisted of holdouts in Wulfsburg: if we can take back one city, we can take them all back! We’ll liberate Wulfsburg and save its stalwart holdouts. Explore new ways to hunt zombies with four new survivors and new Equipment cards featuring magic weapons and potent spells! Beware, however: the quick and merciless Zombie Wolfz are on your tail all through 10 breathtaking new missions. They’re fast, vicious and deadly. Gather all the help you can find to fight this new threat. Slash your way to the top of the towers marking your new hunting ground. Who’s the apex predator now? Welcome to Wulfsburg!"
