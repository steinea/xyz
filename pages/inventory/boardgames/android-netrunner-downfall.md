#### Abstract

"Downfall is the first set of the Ashes Cycle, Null Signal’s first original Netrunner expansion. It is compatible with Android: Netrunner and contains 65 brand new cards, including four new identities (two Runner and two Corp). It was designed to be both familiar to experienced Netrunner players and full of interesting possibilities."
