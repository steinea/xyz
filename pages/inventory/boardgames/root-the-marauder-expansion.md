#### Abstract

"The Marauder Expansion introduces two new factions to the Woodland—the Lord of the Hundreds and Keepers in Iron—alongside four hirelings and a new setup draft suitable for both casual and competitive play.

Play as the:

Lord of the Hundreds – Oppress the Woodland and burn it to the ground if need be. You suffer no dissent.

Keepers in Iron – Lead your exiled order of devout knights into battle to recover ancient relics. For glory!

Discover unique strategies and make the Woodland wilder by adding hirelings:

Forest Patrol & Feline Physicians – Secure your realm and heal deadly injuries with Marquise elites.

Last Dynasty & Bluebird Nobles – Crush your foes and prove your legitimacy with the last Eyrie regiment.

Spring Uprising & Rabbit Scouts – Revolt against despots and fight for freedom with Alliance sympathizers.

The Exile & The Brigand – Stalk the forests and steal what you need with these Vagabond mercenaries.

This is an expansion. A copy of Root the board game is required to play."
