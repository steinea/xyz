#### Abstract

"Expand your data pool with Council of the Crest, the third Data Pack in the "Kitara Cycle" for Android: Netrunner!

Council of the Crest introduces three copies of twenty-new cards to the world of Android: Netrunner focusing on the Sub-Sahran League, the efforts to build a second elevator connecting earth to the moon, and the conspiracies and corporate subterfuge underlining both. In this pack you will find a powerful new virus, a pair of dueling currents, a brand new NBN Identity, and much more."
