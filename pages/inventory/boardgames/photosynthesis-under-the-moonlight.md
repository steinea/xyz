#### Abstract

"Enhance the world of Photosynthesis with the Under the Moonlight expansion! The moon turns in the opposite direction of the sun and casts its moonlight into the woods. Players collect lunar points for their new forest animal to activate special powers. Which one of the 8 animals will be yours? The boar collects trees, the hedgehog plants seeds, the fox steals and moves seed around, the owl turns lunar points into sun pointsâ€¦ Strategically position your animal by the moonstones, activate their capabilities at the right time, and be careful to not stay too long in the shadow of the Great Elder Tree! This expansion requires the base game Photosynthesis to play."
