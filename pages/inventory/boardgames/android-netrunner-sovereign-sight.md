#### Abstract

"Everything that was old is new again. Sovereign Sight is the first Data Pack from the "Kitara Cycle" for Android: Netrunner, and its sixty cards (three copies each of twenty different cards) transport the game's Corps and Runners to the shores of Lake Victoria, where the nations of the Sub-Saharan League are gambling everything on their ability to create a second beanstalk.

The first Data Pack to release following the 2017 rotation, Sovereign Sight sets the course for the new Android: Netrunner metagame, focusing on bluffs, gambits, and tense interactions between Corp and Runner."
