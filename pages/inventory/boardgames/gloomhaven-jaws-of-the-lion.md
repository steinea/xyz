#### Abstract

"You are a member of "Jaws of the Lion", one of the most infamous mercenary groups in this run-down backwater city of Gloomhaven. When a sinister cabal starts disappearing the less fortunate of the city, it somehow falls to you to get to the bottom of it....so long as you get paid for your trouble.


Gloomhaven Jaws of the Lion is a fully stand alone, and cooperative, campaign game of tactical combat set in the same unique fantasy world of it's #1 rated* predecessor Gloomhaven.

Players will assume the roles of 4 new hardened mercenaries and work together to fight through a new prequel campaign full of choices, challenges, and twists.

New built in tutorials, learn-to-play guide, and play-surface scenario books allow players to jump into the action more quickly and easily than ever before."
