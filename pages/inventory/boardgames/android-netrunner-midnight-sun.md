#### Abstract

"Midnight Sun is the first set of the Borealis Cycle, set in the frigid Arctic Circle. The corps plunge through thawing permafrost and thinning ice sheets in search of their next plunder, and runners have to turn to new tricks to stop them.

Midnight Sun contains 65 brand-new cards, including five new identities, and marks a bold new direction in Null Signal Games’s design philosophy."
