#### Abstract

"A terrible corruption has spread over the world of Deccaria. The royalty have succumbed to its maddening haze. The Golden Blade Syndicate (a 40-strong band of professional adventurers) has been called upon by the High Crown Council to solve the mystery of this growing blight.

Regicide Legacy is the follow-up to 2020's Regicide. The challenging co-op trend continues in this campaign game spread over 12 perilous missions. Players will need to work together to beat each mission, solving the mystery of corruption along the way.

Mission 1 familiarises the players with Regicide, allowing new players to come to grips with the system, but subsequent missions bring new enemies, dynamic challenges and powerful upgrades.

Recruit new adventurers to the party, access all-new classes and unlock powerful items that will change the way you play the game.

But be warned! The faint of heart need not apply. Only those brave enough to take on brutal beasts and perilous opponents should venture into the world of Regicide Legacy!"
