#### Abstract

"Four players can play out of the Earthborne Core Set, but that requires that each player resists splashing outside of their role. This is a game that feels best when you're creating unique and interesting characters, so we do suggest the doubler for groups of 2-4 players. It expands options during initial deckbuilding and throughout the game via rewards and trading, but it is not required."
