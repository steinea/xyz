#### Abstract

"Who will control Mars? Every day, the Big Four insinuate more of their products, services, management, and agendas into every aspect of Martian life, and in Earth's Scion, the third Data Pack in the "Red Sand Cycle" for Android: Netrunner, we watch as they spread more fully across the whole of the red planet. This leads to heightened tensions between Martian Corps, Runners, and Clans, and the sixty new cards (three copies each of twenty different cards) from Earth's Scion reveal just how far they may go in order to see their competing visions come to pass."
