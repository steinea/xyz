#### Abstract

"The first expansion for Dune: Imperium, Rise of Ix expands and deepens the thrilling gameplay that has made Dune: Imperium one of the best board games of recent years.

Acquire technology for lasting benefits. Dominate the battlefield with mighty dreadnoughts. Outmaneuver your opponents by dispatching infiltrators. Experience the new Epic game mode for a longer, high-stakes challenge. Let your fortunes ascend with the Rise of Ix.

The struggle for control of the Imperium continues! Technological innovations from the planet Ix offer strategic advantages to those able to acquire them. The spreading reach of the CHOAM corporation provides trade resources to fuel your rise to power. Familiar strategies take on new dimensions as fearsome warships reshape the conflict on Arrakis. And the leaders of three more Great Houses enter the fray."
