#### Abstract

"Work together with your fellow farmers to save the Valley from the nefarious Joja Corporation! To do this, you'll need to farm, fish, friend and find all kinds of different resources to fulfill Grandpa's Goals and restore the Community Center. Collect all kinds of items, raise animals, and explore the Mine. Gain powerful upgrades and skills, and as the seasons pass, do your best to protect the magic of Stardew Valley!"
