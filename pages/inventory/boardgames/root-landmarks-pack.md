#### Abstract

"Bring the Woodland to life with landmarks! Each landmark offers players new strategic challenges and tactical possibilities. Best of all, they work with each of Root's four maps!

The Landmark Pack includes four screen-printed wood landmarks:

* Barter for anything you need at the Black Market.
* Find new friends and followers in the Lost City.
* Craft a masterwork at the Legendary Forge.
* Sit proud upon the grand throne in the Elder Treetop."
