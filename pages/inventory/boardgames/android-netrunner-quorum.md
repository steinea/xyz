#### Abstract

"The Flashpoint Cycle of Data Packs for Android: Netrunner has been full of desperate and violent Corps. Now, at the end of the cycle, as the U.S. government threatens to strip New Angeles of its privileges as a special commerce zone, Quorum gives us sixty new cards (three copies each of twenty different cards) that focus on getting back to business as usual. That means you'll find the Corps investing in their futures, deploying advanced new economic operations, bribing powerful and highly connected politicians, and layering their servers with brand new ice.

It's not just the Corps that are eager to end the violence and get back to business. Still, what you want to do and what you need to aren't always the same thing. In the wake of the Twenty-Three Seconds incident and the ensuing devastation, you'll still find the game's Anarchs looking to burn things down, even as the Criminals double their efforts to work undetected and the game’s Shapers show off their newest tricks."
