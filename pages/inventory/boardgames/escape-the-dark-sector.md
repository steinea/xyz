#### Abstract

"The second game in the Escape the Dark series, Sector is a simple, sci-fi adventure game with a focus on atmosphere and player cooperation. It takes around 5 minutes to set up, lasts around 45 minutes, and no two games are ever the same.

Playing as the beleaguered crew of an impounded starship, players find themselves confined to the detention block of a vast space station. Using a variety of advanced gear and weaponry, they will embark on a desperate mission together -  to find their ship and blast their way home.

Along the way, the crew will have to overcome a variety of dangers, traps, and terrors. From cyborg guards and faulty replicators to killer alien organisms, each challenge is represented by a large, beautifully illustrated chapter card.

As these immersive chapter cards are revealed one by one, players must make decisions about what to do, before using a combination of tactical dice combat and the timely play of item cards to complete them.

The goal of the game is to complete every chapter in the mission deck, and then defeat the final boss to recover your starship. To win, you must keep each member of the crew alive - if any player is killed the game ends immediately."
