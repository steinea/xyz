#### Abstract

"Launch Minor Companies, each with their own specialty. Construct sprawling infrastructure, generate revenue, and watch stock values soar. Pay out earnings or reinvest in your company to push for the next big thing. As Minor Companies combine forces to become Major Corporations, their special abilities persist while their reach expands. Create captivating combinations with unique advantages.

Every game unfolds on a unique player-built map in an innovative evolution of the 18XX system. Tailor the game to your preferred length, table space, and skill level, ensuring every session feels fresh.

Crafting a new map every play means no two games are alike. The modular map injects endless variety and amplifies the operational mechanisms."
