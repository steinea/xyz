#### Abstract

"Uprising is the second set of the Ashes Cycle. It is compatible with Android: Netrunner and contains 65 cards, including three identities (two Corp and one Runner). While expanding on the designs of Downfall, it also introduces new ideas like lockdowns—powerful Corp operations that dissuade the Runner for an entire turn."
