#### Abstract

"Enter the SSL with Whispers in Nalubaale, the fifth Data Pack in the "Kitara" cycle for Android: Netrunner The Card Game! Whispers in Nalubaale introduces three copies of twenty new cards for every faction, including a new Anarch identity that gives the runner new ways to spend their virus counters, and a risky new tool for Jinteki that pays dividends economically as it invites the runner to explore their deadly servers. Expand on the themes found in the Revised Core Set with Whispers in Nalubaale!"
