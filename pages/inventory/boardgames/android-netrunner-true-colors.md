#### Abstract

"There are three realities in the world of Android: Netrunner.

You have the meat world. There, Corps are massive conglomerations, comprised of thousands of employees, managers, CFOs, and CEOs, all housed in towers of glass, steel, and plascrete. In the meat world, Runners need to eat and breathe and sleep; they may be extraordinary individuals, but you wouldn’t necessarily recognize them as you walked past them on the street.

In True Colors, the fourth Data Pack in the Spin Cycle, the Corps and Runners of Android: Netrunner struggle to control the flow of information in three realities – the physical world, the virtual world, and the world of public perception. Sixty new cards reinforce each faction’s core strengths and add layers upon layers of bluffs and deception. With a host of cards to manipulate tags and bad publicity, True Colors brings the game’s high stakes cybercrime more fully into the public eye than ever before. Can you separate the truth from the spin?"
