#### Abstract

"Clear pollution, fight mechs, breach walls, build camps, and rewild factories in this new cooperative board game from the designer of PARKS and the creator of Bloc by Bloc. Play as one of four unique animal factions: the Council with its fortitude and bread, the Order with its wisdom of the flame, the Sect with its ingenious inventions, and the Coven with its spells and subterfuge. Can the defenders band together to heal the land and defeat the machine invasion? Or will the Commonwood succumb to an endless industrial winter? Itâ€™s up to you and your comrades to decide."
