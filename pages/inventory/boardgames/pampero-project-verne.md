#### Abstract

"Uruguay did not rest on its laurels after trailblazing the country's conversion to renewable wind and solar energy. Now they're working to convert the transportation and heavy industry sectors to renewable hydrogen energy! Code-named Project Verne, this effort will once again set a new clean energy standard for the world!

The Project Verne expansion to Pampero includes several new ways to play. Use some or all of the rules and components, including:

CO2 - An abundance of cards and tiles to support the introduction of CO2 into the game. Gain CO2 tokens when building wind farms and use those tokens to help pay for electrical towers. Tokens can also be spent after 1st and 2nd scoring for various bonuses.

H2 - Used together with the CO2 rules and components, H2 provides numerous rules and components to support production of H2 fuel containers that can be delivered to local markets or exported via tanker ships.

Innovations and Freelancers - Hundreds of cards, wooden tokens, tiles, and other components! New bonus actions can be combined to explore different strategies and create powerful combos.

Low-Tech Towers - Tiles are not added to the tower bonus board during setup. Instead, new electrical tower bonus tiles are placed beside the board at the start of the game. Players take the board's pre-printed bonus, then add the new low-tech tower tiles. These new tiles remain on the board and provide a permanent bonus like the pre-printed bonuses.

Events - Event tiles are added to the board under the first and second scoring and provide new effects after scoring.

Lots, lots more!"
