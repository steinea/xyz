#### Abstract

"This expansion adds House Ecaz and House Moritani, to DUNE: The Board Game.

House Ecaz: House Ecaz is ruled by Archduke Armand Ecaz, who is well respected in the Landsraad and keen to strengthen his standing by forging lasting alliances.

House Moritani: Led by the ruthless and cunning Viscount Hundro Moritani, the Moritanis did not hesitate to use terror tactics to conquer their enemies, resorting to assassination, sneak attacks, and sabotage."
