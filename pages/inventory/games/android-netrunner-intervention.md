#### Abstract

"Intervention is the fourth Data Pack in the Flashpoint Cycle for Android: Netrunner, and its sixty cards (three copies each of twenty different cards) deposit you in the streets of New Angeles in the wake of the Twenty-Three Seconds incident. The economy is in free fall not just in New Angeles, but worldswide. For days the city lurches deeper into chaos. There are riots. There are kidnappings. And then the corps open fire on each other…

There's damage everywhere in Intervention. Meat damage, brain damage, and collateral damage. In keeping with the themes and aggressive stances of the Flashpoint Cycle, Intervention continues to provide us access to a set of desperate corps forced to show their teeth. We also find a new Haas-Bioroid identity, a new Shaper identity, a handful of Runner cards that dare you to run despite the risks, and a place of sanctuary in which the Runners can hide."
