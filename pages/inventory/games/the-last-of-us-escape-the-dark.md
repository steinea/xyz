#### Abstract

"The Last of Us: Escape the Dark is a new board game of atmospheric adventure set in the world of the critically acclaimed Naughty Dog franchise.

Powered by the latest evolution of the Escape the Dark system, The Last of Us: Escape the Dark offers solo and co-op multi-player modes, allowing up to 5 players to experience this iconic setting in a brand-new way.

Playing as a group of survivors, you will weave your own unique story of survival and companionship as you explore a open world map.

Beginning your journey in a forsaken quarantine zone, your goal is to travel to the reputed safe haven of Jackson while keeping everyone in the group alive.

Carefully plot your route through the troubled landscape, resolving immersive Chapter cards at each location to gain vital intel, weapons, and equipment.

Survival will depend on making difficult choices, and on tactical use of Item cards and custom dice to overcome a variety of threats including Hunters, FEDRA agents, and the dreaded Infected."
