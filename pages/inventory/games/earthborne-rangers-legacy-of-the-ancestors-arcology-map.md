#### Abstract

"Expand the open world available to you in Earthborne Rangers by diving into a hidden, underground realm that unveils an entirely new campaign, one that weaves seamlessly into the core experience. New beings to meet, new missions to complete, new rewards to gain, new secrets to uncoverâ€”just more of why we love Earthborne so much ... Includes Arcology Corridor Map (never delve without a map)"
