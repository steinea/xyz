#### Abstract

"Hear ye, hear ye: Your Grace is primed for her voyage, and has chosen you to accompany her! For the Queen is a card-driven collaborative storytelling game that invites you to tell a dramatic narrative about a Queen’s journey with you, her companions. What will you learn about her (and yourself) along the way? And in the end, will you stand for or against her?

Get started by choosing your Queen from among 25 lavishly illustrated Queen cards—or create your own! Launch into gameplay in minutes with the guided Rules cards, then read and answer the Question cards to develop a world, your characters, and their relationships with each other and the Queen. Ultimately, answer the final question: when your Queen is attacked, do you defend her? 

This is the second edition of the beloved indie storytelling game created by Alex Roberts, a Diana Jones Award-winning designer, with a completely new visual design, more elegant packaging, and added cards and all-new Queen illustrations from a diverse team of talented artists."
