#### Abstract

"Nemed is the second expansion to Inis, the area-influence game rooted in Celtic history and Lore. Nemed incorporates three different modules that will change the dynamics of your game.

With the Nemetons module, try to gain control of these sacred sites. They will award you deeds based on various conditions and adjacency, as you can't enter the Nemetons!

With the Hollowed Sanctuaries module, dedicate your sanctuaries to legendary heroes! Give offerings to these particular sanctuaries, and receive special favours based on the hero you honored.

Finally, the Territories and Epic tales module will bring more variety to various element of the game. Discover 10 new epic tale cards, 5 new territory tiles, and new advantage cards."
