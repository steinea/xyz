#### Abstract

"Betrayal at House on the Hill: 3rd Edition gets a frightening addition with the release of The Werewolf’s Journey: Blood on the Moon, an expansion that allows players to choose from an additional character at the beginning of the game. Sara may look like your typical teenager, but that will all change in the most dreadful and terrifying way as she transforms into feral werewolf when the haunt occurs!

The Werewolf’s Journey: Blood on the Moon include two highly detailed miniatures as well as five specifically designed haunts to include the werewolf into the story. Also included are four game cards, two room tiles, and a custom scenario card."
