#### Abstract

"Far to the north, the city of Wintergrad had been a haven in the cold. But now, it’s not just the icy wind that bites. Necromancers and zombies have besieged the town. Only the few remaining stalwart Survivors can turn the tide.

Zombicide: White Death is a standalone expansion to Zombicide: Black Plague. Survivors are holed up in the city of Wintergrad. The city’s battlements offer places for Survivors to stay high above their foes while they Guards are ready to give their lives to help the cause. But Survivors must beware of Necromancers and the Corruption they’ll spread throughout."
