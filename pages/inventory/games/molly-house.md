#### Abstract

"It's 1723. You walk through the streets of London, hiding your inner-most desires from the Society of the Reformation of Manners as you head to Mother Clap's. This may look like a coffee shoppe but inside are back rooms where loud festivities, intimate gatherings, and a thriving queer community is growing.

Molly House is a new strategy board game designed by Jo Kelly with additional design from Cole Wehrle & Ricky Royal with illustrations by Rachel Ford."
