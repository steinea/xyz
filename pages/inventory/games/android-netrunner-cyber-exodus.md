#### Abstract

"In Android: Netrunner - Cyber Exodus – the third Data Pack in the Genesis Cycle, featuring sixty new cards (three copies each of twenty individual cards) – the high-stakes of cybercrime in Android: Netrunner push runners and corporations to find the latest and greatest advancements in stealth and security. As the game's seven factions fixate on bleeding edge technology, they find upgraded ice, new hardware for runners, new research, and ambushes. This new tech derezzes the limits of the possible while it reinforces the efficiency of each faction's standard methods of operation."
