#### Abstract

"X marks the stops! Flip a card, choose a subway line, and cross off the given number of stops on your map. Earn bonuses for making transfers, but lose points for incomplete tracks. Everyone plays at the same time, so there's never a dull moment as you race to complete routes. Get the highest score and become an underground sensation!

These two new subway maps, Taipei and Kuala Lumpur, offer new challenges to this great game! Can you conquer them?"
