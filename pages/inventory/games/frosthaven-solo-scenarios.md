#### Abstract

"A set of scenarios specifically designed for strategic solo play - scenarios that highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each class and forces players to really get under the hood and learn to play each class masterfully.

This includes a 24-page scenario book of 17 all-new solo scenarios and a deck of 17 item cards - rewards for completing each of the missions."
