#### Abstract

"The cards in Android: Netrunner - Trace Amount – the second Data Pack in the "Genesis Cycle", with sixty cards (three copies each of twenty different cards) – enable players to dabble with bold new deck configurations, even as they reinforce the core mechanisms and personalities of the game's seven factions. Runners gain new events while corporate executives look to fund new operations. Players will also find new hardware, resources, icebreakers, ice, agendas, assets, and upgrades. Trace Amount is a perfect Data Pack for fans of bluffing as its many events and operations open new surprises and synergies, and prove in more than one way that a card in the hand is worth two or more actions on the table. And as one might expect, in a Data Pack all about bluffing and surprises, Jinteki features prominently, gaining a new identity."
