#### Abstract

"After betraying and destroying House Atreides, the Emperor has given the Harkonnens control over the planet Arrakis once more. But a mysterious warrior named Muad’Dib has risen to power among the Fremen, threatening the schemes of the Emperor and his allies. No house or faction can stand idle as the flow of spice to the Imperium is threatened by all-out war. But any power can be influenced...or betrayed.

Uprising is a stand-alone sequel that expands on Dune: Imperium’s blend of deck-building and worker placement. Continue to balance military might with political intrigue, wielding new tools in pursuit of victory. Spies will shore up your plans. Vital contracts will expand your resources. Or learn the ways of the Fremen and ride mighty sandworms into battle! Plus, a new six-player mode pits two teams against one another in the biggest struggle yet! The choices are yours.

The Imperium awaits!"
