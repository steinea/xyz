"Mounted upon the KX139 Ta’unar Supremacy Armour, the Nexus Meteor Missile System provides T'au battlefield commanders with a swift, highly mobile and devastating response to enemy ground assault troops and armoured vehicles. When fired in combination, its photon flashes and high explosive projectiles can not only tear through infantry ranks or vehicle armour, but any survivors of the attack will be left blinded and disoriented, making them vulnerable to other advancing T'au forces.

The Nexus Missile System is a primary weapon of the KX139 Ta’unar Supremacy Armour, which is available to buy separately. This multi-part resin kit includes the all of parts needed to build the weapons system and mount it on the Supremacy Armour’s upper torso.

This resin modelling kit is not a toy – it is a collectible item and construction should only be undertaken by expert Warhammer hobbyists aged 15 years and over.

This kit is supplied unpainted and requires assembly – we recommend using Citadel paints."
