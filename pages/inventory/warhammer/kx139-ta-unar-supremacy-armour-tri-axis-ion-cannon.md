"A rapid-firing, multi-chambered particle weapon, the firepower of which is unmatched for its size in the T'au arsenal, the Tri-axis Ion Cannon is designed to blast a burning hole through enemy formations. It can adjust its power levels and rate of fire to deal with light vehicles or heavy armour with precisely controlled lethality.

The Tri-axis Ion Cannon is an arm-mounted weapon for the KX139 Ta'unar Supremacy Armour, which is available to buy separately. This multi-part resin kit includes the mounting arm and shoulder plate and can be built for either the left or right side of the Supremacy Armour.

This resin modelling kit is not a toy – it is a collectible item and construction should only be undertaken by expert Warhammer hobbyists aged 15 years and over.

This kit is supplied unpainted and requires assembly – we recommend using Citadel paints."
