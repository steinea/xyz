"An absolute colossus of a machine, piloted by graduates of the Ves'oni'Vash, the KV128 Stormsurge is designed as an extreme heavy-weapons platform. Not as manoeuvrable as a Riptide, instead relying on thick armour and devastating loadouts, these hulking, squat ballistic suits are capable of changing the course of a battle in seconds with a decisive volley of astonishing firepower. Fitted with thrusters to counter recoil, bristling with pulse weaponry and missile pods, the Stormsurge is the T'au Empire's Titan-killer.

The Stormsurge comes with a truly amazing amount of offensive firepower - a cluster rocket system, a pulse driver cannon that can be replaced for a pulse blast cannon; a twin smart missile system and twin T'au flamers that can also be replaced with either a twin burst cannon or a twin airburst frag projector!

This multi-part plastic kit contains all the components necessary to build one KV128 Stormsurge, ballistic suit of the T'au Empire. It includes an astonishing 171 components - four head options, two pilot assemblies, a reactor suite, two leg assemblies and two sets of stabilising thrusters! Various vents and assemblies can be modelled optionally closed or open, and the whole miniature has incredible posability. Includes one Citadel 170mm Oval base.

This miniature is supplied unpainted and requires assembly â€“ we recommend using Citadel Plastic Glue and Citadel Colour paints."
