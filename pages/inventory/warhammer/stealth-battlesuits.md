"Stealth Battlesuits are relatively lightweight and specialised to their role within the T'au Empire's Hunter Cadres. Instead of simply protecting their pilot with layers of armour, they conceal them behind fields of sensor-baffling stealth technology. Benefiting from jet-assisted speed and impressive firepower, teams of these scouts make excellent forward operatives who can deploy homing beacons to guide entire insertion forces into battle from low orbit.

This multipart plastic kit builds three Stealth Battlesuits, accompanied by a Marker Drone. Each Stealth Battlesuit is armed with an infantry-shredding burst cannon, but one can instead be equipped with an anti-tank fusion blaster. The kit includes an alternate faceplate and support systems for your Shas'vre leader, and you'll also find a small miniature representing a Homing Beacon.

This kit includes 49 plastic components, 3x Citadel 32mm Round Bases, 1x Citadel 25mm Round Base, and 1x small flying base. These miniatures are supplied unpainted and require assembly â€“ we recommend using Citadel Plastic Glue and Citadel Colour paints."
