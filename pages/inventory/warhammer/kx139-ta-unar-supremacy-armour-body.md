"T'au Supremacy armour is larger than any other current class of battlesuit. It is intended for a task that the T'au Empire has not yet had to face – the defence of worlds within their growing domain from the counter-expansion forces of other races. Lacking the manoeuvrability of other battlesuits, the KX139 Ta'unar Supremacy Armour was designed for static defence, carrying massively destructive, long range weapons.

Encountering increasing numbers of enemy heavy assault elements, from Imperial Knights to the towering alien monstrosities of the Tyranid Hive Fleets, even the heavy flyers of the T'au have found themselves outclassed. Earth Caste engineer Fio'o Ke'lshan Sho'aun developed the KX139 to mount a dynamic yet stoic defence against such foes, engaging them at range and dominating the battlefield.

While its main weapons take on enemies at extreme long range, the Supremacy Armour's Vigilance Defence System incorporates smart missile launchers and twin-linked burst cannons that can deal with foes at close quarters, including infantry brave or mad enough to charge at these towering battlesuits. The KX1039's Barrier Shield Generator provides it with enhanced protection, even from the devastating weapons mounted on Imperial Titans.

This multi-part resin kit includes components to build the legs and torso of the T'au KX139 Ta'unar Supremacy Armour including a 160mm round base.

This resin modelling kit is not a toy – it is a collectible item and construction should only be undertaken by expert Warhammer hobbyists aged 15 years and over.

This kit is supplied unpainted and requires assembly – we recommend using Citadel paints."
