"Gundam Aerial from *Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch of Mercury* joins Bandai's HG model-kit lineup! The shield can be separated into 11 parts, which can be connected to various parts of the Gundam; the shell unit is reproduced by combining molded parts, double-sided seals and clear parts, and it can be assembled in the light-emitting form and the non-light emitting form. The beam parts are molded in clear material; the double-sided stickers have a pattern printed on the adhesive surface, to express transparency and depth by sticking them to the inside of the transparent parts. Order this amazing new Gundam for your own collection today!"
